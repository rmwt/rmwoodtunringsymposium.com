					<p><font color="#FFFFFF">John�s professional career was as an engineer working for a major electronics company during which he worked with a wide variety of equipment and systems. He has been doing woodworking all of his life but when he took early retirement he rediscovered woodturning which has turned into a second career. John applies his unique engineering perspective to woodturning projects to provide understanding of the principles behind the operations. He has been known to �push the envelope� of woodturning technology. Teaching, demonstrations and writing about woodturning topics provides enjoyment and consumes a lot of his time.. He has several articles in the American Woodturner. One of John�s strengths is to provide explanations of why and how things work in a way that is understandable to �normal people�. Two of his American Woodturner articles delve into the mysteries of how vacuum systems work and how to get the most out of them. Another article covers the topic of bowl saver systems and how they work. There are several more articles being developed. John is active in the Rocky Mountain Woodturners in Northern Colorado serving as an officer and is involved with the planning and running the annual RMWT Symposium.</font><br>
					<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Several years ago when I was considering building a vacuum chucking system, I was concerned about the size of the investment only to be used for finishing off the bottoms of bowls. When I finished building the vacuum system, I turned it on and it worked, but how well is it working? The literature I was able to find did not have any information on verifying correct operation nor how to trouble shoot and repair. This led me to study vacuum systems and apply my engineering background to them. I kept pushing to find out what else I could do with it. This led to two articles published in the American Woodturner; Understanding and improving Vacuum Chucking Systems February 2011, Vol 26, No. 1 and Compliant Vacuum Chucking System June 2012, Vol 27, No.3.
Two of the biggest challenges for woodturners are tool control and mounting your project on the lathe.</font></p>

                    <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The vacuum chuck can be utilized for much more than finishing off the bottoms of bowls. The techniques for mounting items on a vacuum chuck will be demonstrated along with a bit of troubleshooting. A couple of complete projects will be presented using only vacuum chucking and a live center in the tailstock. My objective is to expand your knowledge and usage of your vacuum chucking systems. Questions and discussions are welcome.</font></p>
                            <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Get the Most from Vacuum Chucking</strong></font></p>
                            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The article �How to get the most from your Vacuum Chucking System� will be published in the October 2014 issue of the American Woodturner. The demonstration will be based on the information contained in this article, a limited number will be available as preprint handouts. In this rotation, we will go through the various parts of a vacuum chucking system, how to assemble a system, trouble shooting and performance testing. Much of the testing is simple using items you readily have in your shop or garage. Using these techniques, you may be able to improve your system to get more out of its usage. Questions and discussions are welcome since they will only enhance your experience.

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Spinning Tops</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">This Hands-On workshop is designed for kids of all ages and skills. Be prepared to enjoy yourself and have some fun making these basic examples of High Tech.  We will explore the basic woodturning skills used to make a spinning top. There should be time to make more than one top and to compare its performance. There will be an arena where you can spin your tops and compete against the others. Time permitting, we will see who creates the �Top-Top�.

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Understanding, and Improving, Vacuum Chucking System.</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">This demo will discuss the configuration and construction of a typical vacuum System and then progress into methods of evaluating and improving its performance. I will demonstrate how to tune up a vacuum system, Topics covered will include:<br>
  - Basic configuration, the minimum number of components and how they are used.<br>
  - Enhanced configurations, simple components that can be added to expand the utility of the system.<br>
  - Detection and isolation of leaks within the system using commonly available items found in most garages/shops.<br>
  - How do you fix the leakage?<br>
  - Discuss the basics of how the vacuum system works, how the vacuum levels are adjusted, etc.<br>
  - Discuss the question &ldquo;How big of a vacuum pump do I need?&rdquo;<br>
  - Different types of vacuum pumps their characteristics and their maintenance.<br>
  - Time permitting, discussion and example of converting am air compressor into a vacuum pump.<br>
  This demo is based on my article &ldquo;Understanding &ndash; and Improving &ndash; Vacuum Chucking Systems&rdquo; that was published in the February, 2011, issue of the American Woodturner.<br>

  </strong></font></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.foxywoodz.com" target="_blank"><font color="#FFFFFF">This demo is a natural follow-on to the above demo. I will demonstrate how a vacuum system can be used to mount and turn any shaped block of wood regardless of its shape, surface irregularities or holes and piercing. I do not use any screws or glue nor do I damage or change any surface other than those which are shaped with the turning tools. This is a new method of utilizing the vacuum system that to the best of my knowledge, has never been done before. I will demonstrate how this system can be used to hold a sphere without the need to build a special purpose chuck that will only hold one size.
  An article on this technique has been written and submitted to the American Woodturner. It has been accepted for publication but the date has not been set. I was told that it should be published this year, 2011.</font></a></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> Inside Out Turning to Construct a Jewelry Organizer</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Using methods outlined in the article �Turning Diamonds�, American Woodturner , February 2010, I will demonstrate the construction of a jewelry organizer. The central column uses inside-out techniques with the remainder of the parts using a combination of spindle and faceplate turning. Starting with a sketch of the desired finished design, I will show how to make a template to ease the turning process. This design for the central column will then be turned by first turning the inside, turning the parts inside out and then turning the outside. One part has a series of slots spaced around the perimeter. The construction and usage of a fixture to make those slots uniform in length and spacing will be shown and discussed. A finial for the top of the organizer will be turned.</font></p>
