<p><font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Jonathan Medina. I began my professional arborist career in 2000. At the same time I began my journey as a wood hunter and sawyer. I was immediately fascinated by the look of the wood in the trees I was trimming and removing. As time went on I dissected more and more trees, curious what each portion of the tree looked like as finished wood. Here I am seventeen years later still curious, perhaps closer to being an expert, but always learning always searching for knowledge of the trees and everything they can become.</font></p>
