<p><font color="#FFFFFF">My art is born from my life-long appreciation for fine art and craft; an ability to see the potential in wood, metal and canvas; and a gift that allows me to transform my vision into graceful turned wood vessels. For me, my greatest creative satisfaction comes when I have the to opportunity to create pieces of art from found, reclaimed and recovered materials. As a self-taught artist, I have no fear of traditional rules or boundaries that shackle many in the art world. Instead, I draw on deep emotion and an independent personality to nourish my creative process. My goal with turning is to coax out the raw beauty of a piece of wood. I keep additional carving or embellishment to a minimum so that the finished product is akin to an organic sculpture. </font></p>
