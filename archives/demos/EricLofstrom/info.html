<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Elementary teacher by day, woodturning artist by night, Eric Lofstrom is a dynamic and passionate instructor. Conscious of the importance tool control plays in the process of creating, Eric�s unique expertise in biomechanics and understanding of tool design permeates his teaching with a constant focus on technique. As a seasoned teacher, Eric communicates complex concepts in easily understood language. He believes it is important to understand the �why� and �how� of technique, not just the �what�. Eric�s passion and exuberance will inspire your world of woodturning with confidence to develop your own artistic voice!</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Skew Skills: Making The Cuts!</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Description: During this demonstration, I will share how to "make the cuts" using only a skew! Learning this foundational tool will make cutting with ALL tools easier. In addition to reviewing basic spindle turning techniques, I will emphasize simple sharpening methods used to create a razor�s edge and key "dance moves" to help you finesse ultra-clean cuts with control! My demonstration will showcase a foundational progression of skew cuts and will end with my favorite skill-honing projects; eggs and my version of elegantly-embellished finger-tip spinning tops.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Square-Rimmed Bowls</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Description: During this demonstration, I will create a bowl with an outward flowing rim using a square-cornered blank. My techniques will showcase the fingernail bowl gouge, negative-rake scraper, and methods of mounting a facegrain blank to the lathe for turning. I will emphasize tool control and efficient biomechanics to create a graceful form. I will demonstrate how to get an ultra clean cut from the tools and will complete the piece with simple, yet elegant embellishments!</font></p>


<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Fitted-Lid Boxes: Finessing Form & Function!</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Description: During this demonstration I will share the process I use to create functional and artistic fitted-lid boxes using small endgrain pieces of wood. In addition to demonstrating spindle and endgrain turning techniques using the skew, parting tool, fingernail grind bowl gouge and negative rake scraper, I plan to show the power of using jam chucking techniques. To complete the project, I will share the techniques I use to obtain a mesmerizing pneumatic "fitted-lid" and one of my favorite dynamic texturing techniques used to give each box a unique embellishment!</font></p>
