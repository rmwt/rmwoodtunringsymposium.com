<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Al worked as a Chemical Engineer in the Food Industry for 36 years.  During that time he developed many new food products which were successfully brought to the marketplace.  This work involved creative process development, equipment design and process testing from small scale to full scale production.  Al worked for a number of well known companies ï¿½ General Foods, Lipton Tea, Continental Baking and Nestle Purina.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Prior to retiring, Al bought his first professional lathe and used woodworking and woodturning machinery in the creation of segmented bowls. Using cut and re-cut woodworking procedures, intricate patterns of exotic woods were synthesized and turned into bowls and vases produced on the lathe.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Upon retirement, Al attended Santa Fe Community College in the Fine Woodworking program.  His skill as a woodturner was recognized and the Department heads requested that he teach Woodturning at the school.  Al agreed and has been teaching Woodturning for over 15 years.  Al estimates he has taught over 1000 students with each student taking full semester classes.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Over the years Al has studied woodturning skills with a number of master woodturners, -Trent Bosch, John Jordan, Christian Burchard and JP Fennel.  He is a member of the AAW (American Association of Woodturners), NMWT (New Mexico Woodturners) and Santa Fe Woodturners.  Al has demonstrated at the New Mexico Woodturners, State Fair and at local middle schools throughout Albuquerque.  His work has been exhibited at a number of galleries in New Mexico and he has sold his work to private collectors.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Al lives in Placitas, New Mexico with his wife Karen.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Everything and Anything You Ever Wanted to Know About the Skew</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The skew is the most valued tool in the woodturners toolbag except for the bowl gouge.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I will go through every cut imaginable using the skew ranging from roughing out, to simple planning, to peeling, to long point leading, short point leading, facing cuts across end grain, making beads (short and long point) leading and coves, making v-cuts,
understanding the tied underhand grip, making rings from the spindle, using the skew as a
negative rake scraper on bowls and platters, using the skew  for boring, centering for pre-drilling and finishing the bottoms of boxes to create square bottoms that are smoothe.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In addition, I will complete some simple projects in which only the skew is used from
beginning to end and finally do a duplicate spindle turning with a multiplicity
of elements using only the skew and completed to specified caliper dimensions.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Lastly, woodturninging practices of how to sharpen the skew will be discussed and
demonstrated to obtain a razor sharp tool.

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Lights, Camera, Action - Making a Thin Walled Hollow Vessel</strong></font></p>
                            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">This demonstration will involve the making of a hollow vessel.  It will cover the process
steps of blank preparation, hollowing sequence steps, and post hollowing procedures.
The hollowing will be done utilizing a camera set-up to obtain a thin walled vessel capable of being pierced.  This technique of camera utilization will be directly compared with fibre optic and laser techniques as alternate methods for obtaining thin walled hollow vessels.  The advantages and disadvantages of each method will be discussed and demonstrated  A final procedure using tension pins as a depth stop to obtain thin wall vessels for piercing will also be discussed and demonstrated.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The woodturner will also be exposed to hollowing tool stabilization and in the end the ability of even the novice woodturner to produce a thin walled hollow vessel will be greatly facilitated.</font></p>
