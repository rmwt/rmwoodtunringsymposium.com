<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Rick Orr is a member of AAW, a member of the RMWT (Rocky Mountain Woodturners), and past President of the FRW (Front Range Woodturners) based in Denver, CO.  He is recognized for both his Rainsticks and his bamboo Fly Rod Tubes, demonstrating both of those items at the 2011 Rocky Mountain Woodturning Symposium.  He has demonstrated for the RMWT (Loveland, CO), FRW (Denver, CO), Pueblo Woodturners (Pueblo, CO), and the Yellowstone Woodturners (Billings, MT).  This will be Rick�s third visit as a demonstrator to the Rocky Mountain Woodturning Symposium.  Rick is a retired Montana State University Chemical Engineer, having worked most of his adult career for General Electric. Rick resides in the Denver, CO metro area.  He can be contacted at rickorr.1848@yahoo.com.   Rick�s bamboo Fly Rod Tubes are featured at www.fishtailflyrodtubes.com.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><Strong>Threaded Elk Antler and Corian Box</Strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In this demo, Rick will turn a threaded box utilizing elk antler for the main body, with Corian pieces for the base and threaded lid. The threads will be made utilizing a �threading jig� and will NOT be hand chased.  Rick will walk you through the use of the threading jig for both male and female threads.  In this demo, the female threads will be made in the elk antler and the male threads in the Corian lid.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">While this demo is geared towards the use of a mechanical threading jig, it will also implore the use of basic jam chucks plus threaded jam chucks.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">A quick review will be made of elk antler as a turning media, the choice of antler pieces, where to get the antler, and it�s relative price.  Rick will also cover the use of Corian as a turning media, it�s preparation, glue up, and acquisition.  Finish techniques are simply sanding up to 12000 grit using Micro-Mesh products for all the pieces, with no other finish applied.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The demo is geared towards the beginner to intermediate turning audience, but will provide some useful information to all.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Small Lidded Boxes</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In this rotation, Rick will demonstrate all the steps necessary to complete a small lidded box from a single piece of wood. He will walk you through the selection of the wood, the decision for which end becomes the top and the bottom, set up, and mounting on the lathe.  The making of the tenon for holding in a chuck, dividing the piece in two for the base and the lid, and jam chucking for holding and finish turning each piece will also be covered.  Some fine details will be added, sanding, and initial finishing will be also on the agenda.  The session will also include some finished examples of his many small boxes. Each tool used in the process will be covered in detail.  This session is especially suited with the beginner to intermediate turner in mind, but might point out some useful ideas to even the advanced craftsperson.</font><br>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Elk Antler Boxes</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Inspired by Pete Holtus, with further input captured from Kip Christensen and Kirk DeHeer, Rick will take you through the process of making a small, simple box from elk antler with contrasting top and bottom made from wood. This simple process will start with obtaining the raw antler (how, where, how much $$$), the preparation of the antler (stabilization), centering, and the addition of a tenon for a chuck. The antler will be turned, sanded, and polished � and the tops and bottoms turned, using jam chucks, with contrasting hard wood.  Examples of several finished boxes will be provided, as well as ideas for more complicated projects out of elk antler (other boxes, napkin rings). This session provides some insight to the use of other turning materials besides wood.</font><br>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Shop Hammers</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Rick was inspired to start making various sized shop hammers after picking up one of his old ones in his shop and realizing how beat up and ugly it really was. In this session, meant for beginning to intermediate turners, Rick will demonstrate all of the steps necessary to produce a decorative, yet very functional shop hammer.  Turning is started between centers for the basic pieces. Some chuck work is used for producing mortises, while turning between centers is used for making tenons.  Glue up of various pieces will be done followed by final turning and finishing.  Some light sanding is used, and the finish is a simple application of oil. The finished product can be used daily in the shop, until it ultimately becomes beat up and ugly � and the process starts all over.</font><br>

  <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Rainsticks</strong></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The �Rainstick� demo will be very similar to the �Fly Rod Tube� demo, but geared specifically towards making a �Rainstick�.  Rick will take you through the 6 critical steps in turning a Rainstick.  Those steps include:  Turning Order, Making Good Fitting Joints, How To Hide (Highlight) Your Joints,  Making The Inside �Guts� of a Rainstick,  End Grain Boring, and Finishing.  Handouts will be available, both at the Demo and on-line</font></p>
