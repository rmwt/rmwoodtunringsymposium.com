<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Although he is a relatively new wood artist, Rudolph Lopez has always had a love of natural objects and the environment in which they flourish. Growing up on a cattle ranch in Florida with his father and uncles who spent most of their time in the woods, he grew to love the outdoors... trees, water and all things relating to nature. To this day, Rudy�s greatest pleasures come from mountain-biking, canoeing, kayaking, hiking and just being in the woods.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Rudy began working with his hands at a very young age and began to develop his creative eye through photography�his first artistic pursuit. With an education in drafting and design, he drew inspiration from the surroundings of his youth, Rudy began his relationship with wood as a craftsman of fine furniture and cabinetry. His desire to explore wood-turning began to develop when he received a natural-edge turned bowl as a Christmas gift from his best friend two years ago. Since that time, Rudy�s natural sense of curiosity has led him to explore the techniques necessary to transform wood from a simple rough chunk into an piece of aesthetic beauty. He has the ability to look at an object, understand how it is made, and recreate it with very little effort. It is as if his brain is linked to his hands by some arcane memory.</font></P>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">When asked what kind of wood he most likes to turn, Rudy�s response was, �imperfect wood, wood with knots, voids, worm holes, decay or any other flaw or defect. To me this is the beauty that God and nature has provided me with as a starting point, and then it becomes a challenge for me to continue this and create something of beauty for others to enjoy�. Rudy�s turned pieces have been featured in the �Rounding The Four Corners� exhibit 2008 and �Restful Places-Cremation Urns and Objects� 2009 at the AAW Gallery of Wood Art in St. Paul, Minnesota.</font></p>

<p><strong>Natural Edge Wing Bowl from a log or crotch section</strong></font></p>

</p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I will be turning a thin natural edge wing bowl from a green log or crotch section. Design and layout considerations regarding limb orientation, crotch figure, keeping or eliminating features or flaws in the wood will be covered. I will explain and demonstrate the technique I use for turning thin on interrupted cuts. Turning thin allows the wood to warp and move which influences the final piece and helps avoid cracking. Explanations on using and sharpening Negative Rake scrapers and sanding wet wood both on and off of the lathe.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Square to round Bowls, Vases and Hollow Forms</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I will explain and demonstrate the process I use to create vase which is square on top and tapers to round at the bottom. Starting with a rectangular blank that has been prepared on the band saw to taper the sides, the remaining exterior corners will be turned away leaving a square top and the four tapered sides. The interior of the vase will then be turned into the square top. Techniques for sanding and/or embellishing the different surfaces of the forms will also be discussed. I will show a variety of ways blanks can be cut on the band saw which will start you thinking about how many different design possibilities there are for square to round bowls, vases and hollow forms.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Thin Stem Natural Edge Goblet</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I will be turning a natural edge thin stem goblet from a green limb using mostly a 5/8" side ground bowl gouge. I will explain limb selection, pith orientation, drying to help avoid cracking and some discussion on using and sharpening negative rake scrapers. Emphasis on tool control, improving skill with the bowl gouge and learning the technique and finesse needed for turning thin stems on goblets.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Hands-on class: Natural Edge Wing Platter from a half log</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">We will be turning a natural edge wing platter from a green half log section. You will improve your tool control while learning the technique and finesse needed for turning thin on interrupted cuts. Using and sharpening Negative Rake scrapers and sanding wet wood both on and off of the lathe will be covered.</font></p>
