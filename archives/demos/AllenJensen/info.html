              <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Turning Bowls</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I will show you the process I use to convert locally harvested urban timbers into beautiful salad bowls.  Using the wood the right way will ensure the bowl will dry correctly and withstand daily use.  I will cover the process from selecting and harvesting the wood,  rough turning the blank,  Drying,  remounting and returning the dry bowl, Sanding,  reverse chucking methods, and food safe finishing techniques.  Along the way I will cover efficient use of the bowl gouge to remove material quickly, and then cover techniques for clean cutting to reduce sanding.  This is a fast paced but in depth demo for anyone interested in turning bowls.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Hollow Vessels</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The hollow form is what really got me hooked on woodturning.   The unlimited directions that you can take this simple form keeps bringing me back to the lathe.   The options for the vessel start of course with the wood, is it plain or really fancy burl.  But  then you can add color, texture, you can reshape the form with carving.  First we need a hollow form, I will turn a vessel concentrating first on the outside form, after all that is what will endure, the shape.   Proper use of the bowl gouge is critical to good form and a clean surface.  Next I will hollow the vessel and show you the many tools that I use to accomplish my turnings and discuss the various tools available.   I will touch on sanding, then mount the vessel to remove the chucking point, and finally talk about finishing.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Platters</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">All woodturners should have wood plates to serve food on.  I will show the process to make a large serving platter or a smaller dinner plate.  T he most important part is to select  the correct blank to turn the plate from.  I will then cover mounting, rough turning and drying green wood blanks.  We will then finish turn a platter and talk about getting clean cuts to reduce sanding and show some decorative techniques that can be added to more decorative platters.</font></p>
