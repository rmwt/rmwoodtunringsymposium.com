<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I have a passion for woodworking that started as far back as I can remember but I have been turning for only 14 years.  Sure, I knew what a lathe was � I didn�t know what amazing things you could do with one.  After my first Dakota Woodturners meeting, I started looking at wood totally differently.  Now I look at the color, grain, spalting, occlusions, edges and what I can transform each piece into.  I love to teach others the things that I�ve learned and share my techniques as well as tales of disaster.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">My turning techniques and inspiration come from the many symposiums, demonstrations and woodturning classes I have attended over the years.  My turning techniques reflect a melding of the turning styles of Trent Bosch, Alan Lacer, Dick Sing, Allen Jensen, Michael Gibson, Pete Holtus and the list goes on.  I also take inspiration from the members of my local woodturning AAW Chapter.  I enjoy each opportunity to interact with new woodturners, their excitement and enthusiasm gives me more energy to expand my woodturning capabilities.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Turning a Natural Edge Burl Vase and enhancement with aniline dye</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I will be turning a small natural edge burl vase utilizing Trent Bosch turning tools and other basic tools.  After completing the turning, I will enhance the burl grain with aniline dye.  The dye technique will include use of multiple colors for a bold and dynamic effect.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Turning a Footed End-grain Bowl</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Not the typical orientation of a bowl blank, the turning will done on the end-grain of the blank.  The project techniques follow a demonstration/class presented by Michael Gibson and I have but my own spin on the hallowing process.  The turning process utilizes basic turning tools and the challenges present by end-grain bowl turning.  The unique foot on the bowl adds to the finished project.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Hands-on � Simplified Hallowing</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The hands-on project will walk through the hallowing process in the completion of a pen & pencil cup.  This project allows the participant to utilize a variety of hollowing tools, while being able to observe the cutting action inside the vessel.  The project will help the beginner try their hand at hallowing and for the more advanced turner to prefect their cut and continuity of wall thickness.</font></p>
