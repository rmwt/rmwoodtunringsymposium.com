<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Born in Omaha, Nebraska in 1942, Steve�s early interest in woodworking led to a degree in Industrial Education from Iowa State University, followed by a 33-year career in industry and social services facilities management. Woodworking was a hobby, concentrating on furniture and clocks. In 1975, he read Dale Nish�s <u>Creative Woodturning</u>, which sparked what has become a passionate interest in artistic woodturning. By 1998 he was turning fulltime and in 2001 he and his wife Anne added a studio to their Bettendorf, Iowa home.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Steve concentrates on developing intricate surface decoration using silver leaf, acrylics and ink on hollow vessels turned primarily of maple, walnut or cherry. His works are found in museums, galleries and collections from New York to California and have been featured in art and craft publications in the United States, England and Australia. The Cheongju International Craft Biennele in South Korea has exhibited his work three times and in 2003 awarded him a special citation.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">His work is in three midwestern museums, the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts, and the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City. He is included in the 2009 book Masters: Woodturning: Major Works by Leading Artists. Another book, Wood Art Today 2, published in 2010, features his newer ultra thin �Spool� series. The latest book to include Steve is Audacious: The Fine Art of Wood, published in 2015.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In addition to woodturning, Steve plays bass clarinet in the Bettendorf Park Band and was a nationally certified fire service instructor and volunteer firefighter for over thirty years.</font></p>
