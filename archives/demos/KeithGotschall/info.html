<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Born in Chicago, Ill. in 1962, Keith lived in the midwest until 1980.  In 1981 he moved to Boulder Co. and began a career in wood working.  After an informal apprenticeship in several different wood shops Keith started his own design and fabrication studio in 1989.  Building furniture mostly on a commission basis, Keith also stretched his talents by doing the occasional speculative piece that would be shown in art galleries or in fine art shows.  He has won numerous awards around Colorado.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Keith is also a sculptor of stone.  Using marble and alabaster from the area Keith has also won many awards for his sculpture.  His work tends to be of a figurative nature, often abstracting the human form.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFFFF">In 1998 Keith visited with a local wood turning friend who let him play around with some of his tools and showed him some of the more modern theory behind wood turning.  Remembering that the lathe was the reason he became interested in woodworking in the first place, Keith was keen to pursue wood turning from that moment on.</font></p>
 <p><font color="#FFFFFF">He now lives in the small mountain community  of Salida,in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. His home and studio are at the base of the continental divide and he shares them with his  wife Catherine.  An avid rock climber, hiker, and hunter, Keith is often found outdoors enjoying Colorados rugged beauty.</font></p>

 <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Lidded Bowl</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">A bowl and matching lid will be made in this demo, a lot of ground to cover in an hour and a half. The uses of the scroll chuck will be gone over for both expansion and contracting modes. Tool use and design potential will be addressed. Great for the novice or intermediate turner.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Secret Salt Shaker</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">This project is a fun reversal on the classic salt shaker. It�s design puts the opening on the bottom, yet no salt is spilled. It is a unique but simple mechanism that allows it to work, but can be a puzzle to figure out. Covered in this demo are basic spindle cuts, as well as aspects of box making. Hollowing end grain with various techniques is shown, and the �back cut� will be demonstrated. Other design options will be discussed and explored. A very fun project that you will want to try out at home.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Scottish Quaich- Winged bowl</strong></font></p>
<p>This demo shows not only how to make a quaich, a two handled drinking bowl of friendship, but also goes into many of the basic cuts and tools that turners use for all of their projects. I will be turning on two axis to make this, and grain direction, tool use and control, and using the chuck in three different ways will be covered.</p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Small bowl turning</strong></font></p>
<p>In this demo I will turn three small bowls with decoration. These will be bowl designs that point at utility as well as a more refined aesthetic. Different ideas in bowl design will be discussed and shown, while various technique will also be imparted along the way. This is going to be a fast moving demo, and one that will be useful for turners on any size equipment.</p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Off Center Platter</strong></font></p>
<p>This demo will show how to make an off center platter, without the use of specialized equipment. All the techniques and design of a normal platter will be covered, as well as design considerations suited to off center work. If times remains after questions etc. I will apply dye and painted decorations.</p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Three legged Stool</strong></font></p>
<p>Everyone should be able to make a stool like this, a family heirloom is well within your reach! I will go over the simple set up and preparation needed, as well as how to approach replication in an easy way. Design of spindle legs, how to cut beads and coves, and all the pommel cuts are shown and discussed. Reproduction of your designs will become easy, instead of a chore.</p>
