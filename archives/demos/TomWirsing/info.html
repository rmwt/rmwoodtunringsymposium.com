                <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Tom Wirsing was born in Roanoke, Virginia, in the Shenandoah Valley, an historic center of American woodturning.</font></p>
                <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Tom began turning wood as a young boy. After graduating from Roanoke College with a degree in Physics, Tom began traveling extensively. He lived in Europe, Asia, and 9 US States. The lathe in his dad�s workshop became distant memory.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">About 20 years ago Tom found himself working for the Hewlett-Packard Company in Chicago, and living in a house with a spacious basement. He bought a lathe, and began turning wood again. At first he made mostly furniture, but almost by chance, he attended a demonstration by Richard Raffan, a very well-known Australian woodturner, who specializes in turning beautiful wooden bowls. Richard took a rough piece of American black cherry timber and turned it into a wonderful bowl. Tom was hooked.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Thus began Tom�s interest in creating art pieces on the lathe. He now turns primarily bowls and platters from a variety of woods. His favorite is figured maple.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Tom is a member of the American Association of Woodturners. Tom has served as two-term president of the Denver chapter of the AAW, and has served two terms as president of the AAW.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Tom resides with his wife Melinda on a small ranch in north Boulder County, Colorado where he grazes Angus cattle and turns wood in his studio overlooking the Colorado Front Range.</font></p>

                            <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>You Can Turn a Perfect Platter.  Here�s How.</strong></font></p>
                            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I will demonstrate the process steps by which a woodturner, even of modest skills, can turn a beautiful platter and can, through the use of bowl gouges and scrapers of several shapes, produce precisely the desired shape (form) with almost no tear-out and requiring very little sanding.  Although the demonstration will not focus on grinding, I will grind frequently during the demonstration and will explain why sharp tools, ground to the right shapes, can easily and quickly produce the desired results.</font></p>

                            <P><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Everyone Can Turn a Perfect Bowl</strong></font></p>
                            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The purpose of this demonstration is twofold:
<br>
1.	To demonstrate techniques for turning a �perfect bowl� using a combination of gouges and scrapers.
<br>
2.	To focus especially on easily-mastered techniques for the use of negative-rake scrapers to fine-tune shapes and curves and eliminating all irregularities and tear-out, even on difficult, highly-figured hardwoods.</font></p>
