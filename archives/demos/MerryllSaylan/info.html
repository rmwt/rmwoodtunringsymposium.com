<p><font color="#FFFFFF">�Form, contrast, pattern, texture and color are primary themes in my work. Bowls and platters serve as my canvas on which to investigate and explore surface manipulation and visual images.  The nature of wood � with its inherent differences in color, grain, texture and density � offers the ground for experimentation with pigments and texture. The recent multiples and installations allow for more complex studies by the juxtaposition of one piece to another. Environment  has always affected my work and living next to a salt marsh with its movement and patterns from tidal action is reflected on my surfaces.  I have been influenced and attracted to the work and themes of artists such as Morandi, Wayne Thiebaud, Agnes Martin, and Hans Coper.�</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Playing with Milk Paint</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">What exactly is milk paint?  What makes it distinctive and how many kinds are there? Demonstration will discuss how to mix and apply, tinting your own colors, combining it with acrylics.  Using it to create texture.  What kind of finishes and/or glazes. Why are so many artists intrigued with it.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Surface Design: Texture and Color</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">How one affects the other. Color can enhance carving and patterns in your turned piece or can totally destroy it. How to choose between paint and dye, why one might be better than the other.  Glazes as a finish or how finish affects color also.  How to combine the different mediums. Why surface preparation is important.</font></p>
