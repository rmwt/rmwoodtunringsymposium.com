<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Jason  received his BFA degree in Furniture Design from William Paterson University in  Wayne, NJ. He continued to study furniture design at San Diego State University  in San Diego, CA where he received his MFA degree. While working on his MFA,  Jason began to show work in many furniture exhibitions throughout the country.  He is currently the Studio Coordinator of the Furniture Design and Woodworking  program at the Anderson Ranch Arts Center in Snowmass Village, CO.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I create three-dimensional objects with subtle hints that will make someone want to explore. In my current body of work the subtle feature is the unsophisticated material used, corrugated cardboard. At first glance the color of cardboard disguises itself as a solid wood material. Further investigation will display a rich undulating texture of stacked corrugated flutes.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">My exploration into the use and function of this low-status and commonly overlooked material is what drives me. Creating furniture, sculpture and two-dimensional artwork with corrugated cardboard is an exciting challenge that often results in a surprisingly elegant, and sometimes whimsical, surface and form.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Turning a Corrugated Cardboard Bowl</strong></font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF">For this demonstration I will use a prepared corrugated cardboard turning blank and explain the process of turning an open bowl. The laminating process, tools and techniques will be discussed/demonstrated.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Turning Out Cardboard Furniture</strong></font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF">In this demonstration I will go over the design and planning process when designing a functional piece of furniture made/turned out of corrugated cardboard. Special considerations need to be made when working on a larger scale and when the corrugations are laminated in different directions.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Slide Presentation of My Work</strong></font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF">This will be a chronological presentation of my work. It will conclude with a short presentation on the Anderson Ranch Arts Center ï¿½ where I currently run the woodshop.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Choosing the Right Materials and the Laminating Process</strong></font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Getting started with corrugated cardboard begins with selecting the right material, knowing how to laminate, proper clamping (with reinforcements if necessary) and what tools work best after a blank has been created. I may do a slide show of how others work with cardboard. </font></p>
