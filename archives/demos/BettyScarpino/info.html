<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Texture, Color, and Finish Turned Objects</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Learn how to add color, bleach, and texture in ways that enhance the natural beauty of wood-turned objects. Dying, liming wax, bleaching, milk paints, acrylics, carving, and 3-D stippling will be covered.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Turned Candleholders, Sculpture, Pods</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">A faceplate-turned disc can be transformed into a unique two-part candleholder or a sculpture. A pod, turned from green wood, is a starting point for a box, a boat, or a sculpture. I will turn a disc and a pod, and then demonstrate safe methods for cutting apart turned objects using the bandsaw.</font></p>
