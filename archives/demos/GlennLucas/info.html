<p><font color="#FFFFFF">No matter where I travel in the world, I find that the challenges associated with bowl turning are universal. In this demo we will take a look at selecting the right cutting edge for the job, getting the tools sharp and then mastering the cuts. From quickly rough shaping a bowl to achieving a smooth surface and fluid curves straight from the bowl gouge. With a little guidance and some practice you can master the techniques of bowl turning.

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">This demo takes a look at each task involved in making a salad bowl such as, processing the log, saving bowls with the Oneway coring system, seasoning, remounting and turning dried bowl blanks and choice of finish. I will share my unique approach gained from 25 years of bowl production.

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Irish Dinner Plate</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In this demo I will show how to make a dinner plate based on a traditional plate discovered in an archaeological excavation in Ireland.
Using basic tools I will show how to get flowing curves and bead details. The use and sharpening of negative rake scrapers will also be discussed. I will show the techniques of wet sanding as this is a very efficient way to sand, creating no dust and a beautiful finish in no time.
