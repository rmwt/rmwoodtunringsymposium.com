<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Introduction to Multi-axis Woodturning</strong></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In the demo I will go over how to mount, layout, and turn a multi axis spindle. Then I will open it up to the audience on what else they would like to see. I usually do a multi axis bowl or hollow form but have also been doing demos on the multi axis pipe form. It's a fun demo that is never the same twice.</font></p>
