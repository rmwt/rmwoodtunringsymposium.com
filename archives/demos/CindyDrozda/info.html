                    <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Cindy Drozda, Boulder Colorado, has worked wood professionally since her first �real� job at age 19, where she taught herself to work with wood. The need to make a pair of chairs brought her to woodturning, but it was the pictures of bowls, vessels, and boxes in the back of Dale Nish�s book that really got her hooked. Before settling on woodturning as a career Cindy worked as a cabinet maker, rebuilt airplanes, machined metal, and made hang gliding equipment.</font></p>


<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Today, her pieces are exhibited at the finest art shows and galleries. Her elegant lidded vessels and boxes with delicate finials bring a contemporary flair to classic forms. A jewel hidden under the lid symbolizes the treasure that life reveals when we make the effort to look deeper. Her trademarks are precise techniques, fine details, and pleasing forms. Cindy will coach you to new levels of excellence in your woodturning!</font></p>
