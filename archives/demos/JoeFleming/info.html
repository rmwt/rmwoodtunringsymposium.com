                            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I have been an amateur woodworker for over 40 years and an amateur woodturner for more than 18 years. My skills are primarily self-taught with assists from various class work, from woodworking publications, and through participation in various woodworking clubs. I have studied with many noted wood artists including, Allan Batty, Stuart Batty, Christian Burchard, Jimmy Clewes, Don Derry, Michael, Hosaluk, John Jordan, Binh Pho, Richard Raffan, Merryll Saylan, and Susan Working. My dad gets the credit for instilling in me a passion for hand-made wood items.</font></p>
                            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I like to explore different forms and techniques in my work.  It would difficult to pin me to a style.  In my club, I�m considered the jack-of-all-trades when it comes to woodturning.  I�m best known for airbrushing and coloring.</font></p>
