            <font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Monster Lathe Tools was founded over a decade ago by tool making icon Randy Privett. As he prepared for retirement, Randy worked hard to hand over his designs and manufacturing processes to his family members so that they could carry on the
              Monster Lathe Tools tradition he had so firmly established. Sadly, Randy is no longer with us, but we are confident we can honor Randy�s legacy by continuing to produce woodturning tools just as he would � using his time-tested designs,
              manufacturing our products with keen attention to details, and providing excellent and personal customer service. All of the tools you see on this site - with the exception of carbide cutters - are manufactured by us. We don't farm out any
              parts or products to other companies to make for us. If we're going to put the Monster name on something, it has to be made here in this shop. <br> Contact info: Todd and Michelle Matejka, Owners<br> Monster-lathe-tools.com
