<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Al's  turnings are inspired by work in mathematics, a love of nature, and fascination  with early American cultures.&nbsp;&nbsp; His work  has appeared in numerous art shows, including four AAW shows.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Maryland Federation of Art recognized  Al's work with an invitational 6-week show in the Baltimore City Gallery. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">He  enjoys sharing his enthusiasm for turning through teaching and demonstrating  for AAW chapters and at regional and national symposiums.&nbsp; Teaching includes John C Campbell, the AAW  Youth program, and running the woodturning program for Maryland Hall for the  Creative Arts in Annapolis, MD.&nbsp; Al&rsquo;s <em>Ball in a Ball</em> presentation may be seen  on <em>the 2010 AAW Symposium Techniques Vol.  1&nbsp; </em>DVD<em>.</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Al&rsquo;s  thoughts on turning:&nbsp;&nbsp; Through selecting  the wood, choosing how to fix it on the lathe and where to shape the surface I  have considerable influence on each piece I turn; yet the wood itself remains a  unique expression of features that recorded its life. My best work combines my  intent with the beauty that lies beneath the last layer that I slice away.  Achieving harmony of form with tree&rsquo;s record of life is my vision of a  successful piece. Reaching harmony of tool movement with the spinning wood is a  successful day.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Suspended Spherical Forms</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">These unique turnings are begun as a spindle turned ball with "wings" on each end.  The turning is then rotated 90 degrees and held in a vacuum chuck while the ball is hollowed through the face grain.  The wings are then carved to complete the form.  Demo includes tips for turning a sphere, multi axis turning, hollowing considerations, making vacuum chucks and a discussion of the carving process</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Ball in a Ball</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Learn a bit of magic and use basic bowl techniques to create an unusual turning. Shape a sphere from a cylinder following a simple layout and make and use chucks for finishing and hollowing the ball. Learn the secret of passing a ball through an opening that is smaller than its diameter to produce the ball in a ball, which is great display piece and a treasured gift.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Natural Edge Hollow Form</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Inspired by the pottery forms of the Southwest, the design focuses on volume and an illusion of function.  When hollowing through the face grain, the natural contours of the bark edge form dramatic rims. We will review the entire process: design, blank selection, mounting, shaping the form, surface refinement, hollowing, reverse chucking, turning the bottom, and finishing options                              </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Turning Triangles</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Multi-center turning is made easy using a side-ground bowl gouge to get a skew like surface.  After using four centers to cut the three faces of the triangle the fun begins by creating three sided bowls, boxes, peppermills, napkin rings, ornaments,  pedestals, and countless other objects.  In the demo Iï¿½ll show how to make 3 sided turning display pedestals, napkin rings, and ornaments.
