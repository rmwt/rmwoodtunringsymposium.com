<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Woodworking has been a major interest of mine for many years now. My early training came from college level woodworking and furniture design courses in San Diego, while my later training came from courses taken in the Fine Woodworking Department at Red Rocks Community College (RRCC) where I currently teach.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">While I enjoy making projects from furniture to small craft items, turning projects are by far my favorites.  I feel nothing highlights and celebrates the beauty of wood quite the same way as turnings.  In addition to turning wood, I also like to incorporate metal into some of my pieces through the use of metal spinning and other techniques.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Currently I run my own small woodworking business and teach courses in, depending on the semester, general woodworking, furniture making, and turning. For more, visit www.facebook.com/glacialstudio</font></p>

Methods (1) & (2) include demonstrations on how to turn the metal flush with the wood�s surface. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Attendees will be introduced to techniques used to turn an elegant wooden wine glass. During the first half of the session techniques for turning the bell of the glass will be demonstrated. The remainder of the time will focus on turning the stem of the glass from a separate piece of wood. Creation of a solid joint between the bell and stem, and use of a vacuum pump to finish off the stem�s base will also be covered.</font></p>
