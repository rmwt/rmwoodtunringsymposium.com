<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Sam has been drawn to working with wood for 45 years.  His experience includes furniture making and restoration, as well as custom cabinetry.  Turning chair and table components set the foundation for a passion for working on the lathe.  Retiring after 39 years in public education, Sam turns daily in his shop in north central Wyoming.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In 2007, he organized a woodturning group that has met monthly since.  In 2010 the Worland Wyoming Woodturners became an AAW sanctioned chapter.  Sam has written articles for Woodturning Design Magazine, been recognized as the featured artist in Woodturning magazine (issue 256-August 2013), and enjoys teaching and demonstrating.  Known as the wyomingwoodturner on YouTube, Sam has produced 230 videos on many topics of woodturning.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">With the help of British turner John Berkeley, author of All Screwed Up, Sam has developed his thread chasing skills.  His four rotations will cover the mechanics of hand chased threads, incorporating threads into a project, and how design plays into boxes with hand-chased threads.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The most important point in the creation of my work is the moment just before a project begins. Whatever skill, experience, and design capabilities I have, now come into play as I take the first step toward making a piece. Once the direction is set, I move forward with my initial intentions and make changes when necessary.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">A particular painting may not be beautiful to everyone. But that same painting will elicit a reaction: an emotion, an opinion or criticism, or an idea that will be a seed for more art. As artists, we are influenced by the creativity of others. I am careful not to allow this same influence to restrict or set limits on my work.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">My current interests include hand chasing threads and coloring wood. I often combine these two disciplines while making a hollow form with a threaded lid and finial. My focus continues to move away from untouched natural wood and toward adding color, applying a sprayed and buffed, lacquered finish or applying a secondary wood as an accent.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Hand Chased Threads: Fundamentals</strong></font><img src="images/angelo-thread-chasing.jpg" width="216" height="384"></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The scope of this demonstration will range from the basics of chasing threads by hand, to the fine points necessary for success.  I will cover the selection of thread chasers, sharpening, preparation of the male tenon and female recess, and the importance of wood selection.  I will demonstrate the use of the traditional tools of thread chasing: point tool, inside tool, armrest, and female recess tool.  Successful thread chasing depends on wood, sharp tools, and understanding how the male and female threads mate for a good connection.  My experience with thread chasing has been influenced by Allan Batty, Bill Jones, and John Berkeley.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Thread Chasing-Lidded Box</strong></font><img src="images/angelo-small-boxes.JPG" width="346" height="194"></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In this demonstration I will cover the proper sequence for the successful completion of a lidded box with threaded fitment.  This procedure includes chasing the female threads in the lid, the male threads in the base, and turning a female �screw chuck� for finishing the bottom of the box.  In this �project� oriented demo, I will utilize the tools and approach that best represents proper thread chasing by hand.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Thread Chasing</strong></font></p><img src="images/angelo-pill-boxes.jpg" width="370" height="208">

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In this demonstration I will cover design elements of lidded boxes and complete a simple threaded container.  This discussion regarding form will include lidded boxes and explore how form effects the placement of the �join� in a project.  Thread Placement and the procedure for chasing threads is determined largely by form or shape.  I will complete a simple threaded box.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Threaded Inserts</strong></font></p><img src="images/angelo-thread.jpg" width="288" height="210">
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">This demonstration will focus on creating hand chased threaded inserts for a project.  Only very dense, straight-grained woods will take an acceptable thread.  Consequently, it is a challenge to utilize softer woods.  Employing this technique will allow you to virtually use any wood in a threaded project.  I will discuss how specific gravity plays an important role in wood selection for chasing threads.  I will demonstrate the procedure for attaching a threaded insert into the opening of a hollow form as well as turning the corresponding threaded lid for the container.</font></p>
