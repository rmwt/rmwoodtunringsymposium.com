    <img src="images/MikeMahoney/mike.jpg" alt="Mike Mahoney" title="Mike Mahoney"> Mike Mahoney has been a professional
    wood turner since 1994. His bowls are featured in galleries across the United States. Mike's work is sought after by
    collectors all over the world. Mike is often requested to demonstrate and teach for wood turning clubs, craft schools
    and symposia. He has traveled around the world to discuss and demonstrate his craft. He is considered an authority in
    woodturning.
  </p>
  <p>
    "I am passionate about my craft and the American Craft movement. I am dedicated to producing quality craft and educating
    the public about woodturning. My wood comes from urban sources (tree trimmers and local cities). I produce all my work
    on the lathe without any emblellishments after the fact, creating a very traditional feel with contemporary ideas. I
    want my work to be attractive as well as useful. For my work to be admired is one thing, but for my work to be used fulfills
    my purpose as a craftsman."

  <p>
    <img src="images/DaleLarson/dale.jpg" alt="Dale Larson" title="Dale Larson"> I have been turning for over 40 years. My
    specialty is turning bowls from local hardwoods. I sell my bowls mostly through galleries. I have demonstrated bowl turning
    and spheres at five AAW Symposiums, at many regional symposiums and around the US, Canada and abroad. I have taught at
    the Campbell and Arrowmont schools. I have published articles about woodturning in four woodworking journals. I was a
    founding member and twice past president of the Cascade Woodturners in Portland, Oregon. I served on the Board of Directors
    of the AAW from 2009 thru 2014, the final three years as President.

  <h3>Turning and drying roughed out bowls</h3>
  <p><img class="right" src="images/DaleLarson/01.jpg" alt="Dale Larson Bowls" title="Dale Larson Bowls"> This class will cover
    the ways to rough out and successfully dry bowl blanks. We will discuss air drying, kilns, soaking in soap, microwave,
    soaking in alcohol and boiling the wet bowl blanks. We will discuss how to get the bowl blank dry without cracking. I
    will then finish turn a roughed out dry bowl showing how to use gouges and scrapers, sanding and finishing.
  </p>

  <h3>Cutting the best bowl blanks out of a tree</h3>
  <p>
    I will start with a slide show of how to cut a tree down and cut up the crotch. I will draw and discuss how to cut a tree
    for the nicest grain pattern in the bowl. The goal here is to get the best bowls out of the tree, not the most bowls.
    I will then finish turn a bowl showing how to use gouges and scrapers, sanding and finishing.
  </p>

  <h3>Turning a sphere by eye</h3>
  <p><img src="images/DaleLarson/14.jpg" alt="Dale Larson Spheres" title="Dale Larson Spheres"> Members will see how to turn
    spheres on three axis all by eye. I will show how to make the cup chucks for the headstock and tailstock . I will turn
    three spheres during the class. Turners will learn how to use a jam chuck to hold the sphere so it can be hollowed or
    decorated.
  </p>

  <h3>Oval turning</h3>
  <p><img class="right" src="images/DaleLarson/20.jpg" alt="Dale Larson Oval Bowl" title="Dale Larson Oval Bowl"> I will show
    how to use the Vicmarc Oval chuck to turn ovals. This will include how to lay out the oval blank and how to mount it
    on the chuck. The attendees will see the special tool challenges related to turning ovals on a lathe. Riding the bevel
    may not work here.

  <p>
    <img src="images/JasonBreach/Jason_Breach_woodturning.jpg" alt="Jason Breach" title="Jason Breach"> My passion for wood
    started at an early age, and with the love and encouragement of my family I started woodturning as a hobby. My parents
    were very supportive enabling me to attend Parnham House for weeklong courses. Leaving school at 17 I attended Buckingham
    College in High Wycombe from where I graduated aged 21 with a BA HONS in Furniture Design and Management. I enjoy the
    challenge of making complex items of furniture and worked in this field for 6 years. After I was made redundant I took
    up a position that enables me both to teach my turning skills but also to hone and develop them further. I have now been
    there for nearly a decade. I now make a range of turned items ranging from commissions to craft shop regulars; each is
    produced to the same exacting standards. I create a range of functional items such as fruit bowls and light pulls to
    purely decorative items such as boxes and other abstract pieces. I also produce solitaire sets where each ball is hand
    turned in a different timber. Please take a look at my gallery for examples of my boxes, solitaire sets and also other
    items that I have turned. I have now also added Wedding Cake Toppers to my range.

    State University Northridge, her work has been exhibited in many museums and galleries, including the Renwick Gallery,
    Museum of Art & Design, and the Yale University Art Gallery. Her pieces have been included in numerous shows such as
    Turning Wood into Art at The Mint Museum, Turned Wood Now at Arizona State University Museum, and the opening exhibition
    at the Museum of Arts & Design. A leader in the use of color and texture on wood and a valued authority in wood turning
    method, Saylan’s writings on art, techniques, and the woodturning field have been published in books and magazines.
  </p>
  <p>
    Saylan’s influence in the wood and craft communities is also felt through her teaching practice and her involvement in numerous
    arts organizations, serving on the boards of both The Wood Turning Center and the American Association of Woodturners
    and as a Master Member in the Baulines Guild. Saylan participated in Artist-in-Residence programs in the United States

    In 2004, the US Department of State’s ART in Embassies Program sent her to Fiji to hold a series of public lectures and
    workshops where her work is on display at the US Embassy. She was invited to participate in the Smithsonian Archives
    of American Art and has recently finished working on that documentation. In 2009, Saylan was AAW, Professional Outreach
    Program Merit Award Winner.

    "Form, contrast, pattern, texture and color are primary themes in my work. Bowls and platters serve as my canvas on which
    to investigate and explore surface manipulation and visual images. The nature of wood - with its inherent differences
    in color, grain, texture and density - offers the ground for experimentation with pigments and texture. The recent multiples
    and installations allow for more complex studies by the juxtaposition of one piece to another. Environment has always
    affected my work and living next to a salt marsh with its movement and patterns from tidal action is reflected on my
    surfaces. I have been influenced and attracted to the work and themes of artists such as Morandi, Wayne Thiebaud, Agnes
    Martin, and Hans Coper."

  <p>
    <img src="images/TrentBosch/Trent-Bosch.jpg" alt="Trent Bosch" title="Trent Bosch"> Working with wood is part of my everyday
    life. It is my connection to the earth and the environment in which I live. While pursuing my Bachelor of Fine Arts degree
    in photography and sculpture, I became interested in the art of woodturning.
  </p>
  <p>
    My philosophy has always been to work in harmony with our environment and not to destroy something in order to create something.
    In all my art, I use only recycled and easily sustainable woods. Being conscious of this has allowed me to work with
    the subtle beauty and dimension this discarded wood possesses.
  </p>
  <p>
    My intent as an artist is to express my feelings about nature, my family and natural processes. I work in series or bodies
    of work, which allows me to explore these issues in depth. Throughout the creative process I am continually reminded
    that I have not and will not ever be content. I will continue to create and strive for that body of work that has yet
    to be conceived.

  <h2>Doug Schneiter</h2>

  <p>
    <img src="images/DougSchneiter/schneiter-headshot.jpg" alt="Doug Schneiter" title="Doug Schneiter"> I started woodturning
    45 years ago as a wee lad in high school, and still have some of those first projects. Since then, I have hopefully improved
    my skills and techniques during my 26 year career of teaching in schools from Jr. High to University, stretching from
    Iowa to New Mexico and Colorado. I have given demonstrations across the Western U.S., including Utah, Montana, North
    Dakota, and Colorado at club meetings, weekend workshops, and symposiums. I still love to teach, and welcome new opportunities.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a long time member of the AAW and the Rocky Mountain Woodturners, of which I have been President for 3 separate terms.
    I was bestowed with the Lifetime Achievement Award from the RMWT, and was honored as a "Long-time Friend of the Utah
    Woodturning Symposium" in 2014. I have shown my work in several shows, including Cheyenne's Western Spirit Art Show and
    Sale, and as a 6-time artist at Loveland's Sculpture In the Park.
  </p>
  <p>
    My work reflects my appreciation and respect for the natural beauty of wood through my minimalistic approach that accentuates
    the natural colors, grain patterns, and characteristics of the timber, without too much embellishment competing with
    those strengths.

  <p>
    <img src="images/MichaelRoper/roper-headshot.jpg" alt="Michael Roper" title="Michael Roper"> Michael Roper is a professional
    woodturner and woodturning teacher who currently teaches at the Red Rocks Community College Fine Woodworking program.
    Roper is a third generation carpenter who fell in love with woodturning during his Associate of Applied Sciences degree
    at Red Rocks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Roper is the winner of the following awards: 2010 and 2012 Educational Opportunity Grant, April 2011 Turning Challenge (Front
    Range Woodturners), 2010 Collegian Award, 2011 Collegian Excellence Award (American Association of Woodturners), and
    2011 1st Place Art Sculpture (Denver County Fair). His work has been featured in Woodturning Magazine (Oct 2012 no 45
    pg 76), American Woodturner (Oct 2011 no 5 pg 1)
  </p>
  <p>
    Roper often chooses the pieces of wood that no other woodturner would dream of turning. Many of his best projects came from
    wood pieces that were the last on the table, pieces that were discarded by the rest of the woodturning community as 'ugly'
    or 'impossible to turn'. Roper is constantly pushing himself to grow as a woodturner, his favorite projects are the ones
    other woodturners told him he couldn't do.

  <p>
    <img src="images/JoeFleming/fleming-headshot.jpg" alt="Joe Fleming" title="Joe Fleming"> Woodworking provides me with
    an outlet for my creativity. I enjoy finding a piece of wood, envisioning what it can become, and then transforming it
    into a beautiful art or craft piece. I make both art pieces and functional pieces, but I always strive for beauty. My
    woodturning consists all types of turning disciplines including bowls, hollow forms, platters, vases, boxes and furniture
    components. I use a variety of wood species in my work including local urban forested woods like eucalyptus, and other
    reclaimed wood. I also use wood from certified forestry projects in the Pacific Northwest, Mexico and Australia.
  </p>
  <p> I have been an amateur woodworker for over 40 years and an amateur woodturner for more than 15 years. My skills are primarily
    self-taught with assists from various class work, from woodworking publications, and through participation in various
    woodworking clubs. I have studied with many noted wood artists including, Allan Batty, Stuart Batty, Christian Burchard,
    Jimmy Clewes, Don Derry, Michael, Hosaluk, John Jordan, Binh Pho, Richard Raffan, Merryll Saylan, and Susan Working.
    My dad gets the credit for instilling in me a passion for hand-made wood items.
