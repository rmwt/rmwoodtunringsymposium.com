<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Stuart is a third-generation woodturner, being a full-time production turner and teacher in his father�s studio at age 16. At 19, he started working for Craft Supplies in England, at the time the world�s largest supplier to woodturners. During his 6 years at Craft Supplies, he was the in-house woodturning teacher and demonstrator. He set up Craft Supplies� first sawmill and oversaw their import business that sold more than 300 exotic woods from around the world.
Stuart has been a professional turner for 36 years and has taught more than 5,000 amateur and professional woodturners.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Stuart�s style of work is greatly influenced by his background as a spindle turner with precise cuts and sharp detail. He uses very simple tools to create his pieces. His work is pure lathe work, with no carving or surface texturing.
</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Stuart�s artwork has been sold through galleries across Europe and the US. He also has artwork displayed in the permanent White House collection.
Stuart believes we have only skimmed the surface of the potential of a wood lathe. With production woodturning as his background, his foundation in woodturning helped him perfect the push cut style and other useful techniques, such as negative rake scraping.</font></p>


<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Bowl Turning with the 40/40 Grind & The Bottom Bowl Gouge Grinds</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The bowl gouge with its 40 degree bevel and 40 degree straight wings is capable of large volume cuts directly to finish without any torn grain. In this demonstration, I�ll be showing how to create both the 40/40 bowl gouge and the bottom bowl gouge grinds freehand on a platform. I will show how both gouges are controlled to form the desired shape with little physical effort and repeatability.

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Off Center Square/Winged Bowl Turning</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In this demonstration, I�ll be showing how to minimize off balance problem while turning. This demo will include both gouge work and negative rake scraping. I will be demonstrating how to easily finish the wings of the bowl with no torn grain or damage to the edges of the piece and how to mate to the wing surface to the bowl shape, leaving a very clean sharp corner.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Perfecting the Art of Cutting</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In this demonstration, I�ll be covering the 7 Fundamentals Setups to eliminate most of the variables in woodturning. I�ll will be demonstrating and explaining how I cut the wood to avoid any torn grain on any species of wood, using a maximum of two pounds of pressure. I�ll also be explaining that knowing grain direct is essential to good cutting and that the techniques for spindle and bowl turning are vertically identical.
