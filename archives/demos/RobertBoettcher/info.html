<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I was born and raised in Wisconsin, and have lived in Minnesota since 1973. I have always loved working with wood, and my interests have focused on woodturning in recent times. I make a variety of items including utilitarian and gift items, as well as items more properly described as wood art.

As with all things wood, each item is a unique piece, embodying the highlights and flaws of a specific piece of wood; nature�s palette. I very much enjoy utilizing wood with interesting and unusual features, such a spalting, knots, worm holes and the like.

I work primarily with woods native to the upper Midwest, including black walnut, black cherry, white birch, white oak, ash, buckthorn and others. I also use some tropical hardwood species, mainly for embellishment, and strive to ensure that this wood is obtained from sustainable sources.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>A New Angle on Bottle Stoppers � Cross-Axis Turning</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Bob will demonstrate a new method of mounting stoppers to achieve an angled top face which can be dished, flat, rounded, or conical, and can be embellished with inserts of wood, stone, glass, or whatever turns you on.
As seen in the photo, the angled face is at the intersection of the stopper axis and the turning axis, hence the term cross-axis turning. The mounting fixture includes a counterweight feature to reduce vibration.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Enhancing your work with inlays.</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Bob will discuss in depth the ins and outs of using inlays to enhance your work. He will demonstrate the techniques used to make a bottle stopper with a stone inlay.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Simple holding device for offset and angle turning of small objects.</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Bob will show how to make and use a simple wooden jig for offset and/or angled turning of bottle stoppers or other small items on a 3/8�-16tpi threaded mount, a cheap and simple way to explore offset turning.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Hands-on Session</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Participants will make and use a simple wooden jig for offset and/or angled turning of bottle stoppers or other small items on a 3/8�-16tpi threaded mount. The jig is held in a 4-jaw chuck and allows linear offset movement and a small degree of angular offset. The goal is to go home with a simple and cheap way to explore offset turning on small pieces prior to purchasing a more sophisticated commercial apparatus. Parts for the jig and stopper blanks to turn will be provided.</font></p>
