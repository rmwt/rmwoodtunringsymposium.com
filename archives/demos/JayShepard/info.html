<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Jay has always been an artist.  From his earliest memories he has played with clay or drew or painted.  Upon entering higher education he had planned to continue his study of pottery but became enchanted with painting.  After finishing his undergraduate degree, he pursued and completed a master of fine arts degree focusing on painting and drawing.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">To support his family and his passion for art, Jay worked in the environmental protection field and contributed to many successful and award winning waste reduction and recycling programs.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">During that time he continued to produce art works and became proficient in woodworking and furniture making.  One day he made a table top.  He thought �this table needs round legs, not squared legs from a table saw.  So he bought a lathe.  He turned the legs, and thought �wow, this is fun!�  Well, he never finished the table and has not made a piece of furniture since.  He has been so taken by woodturning he threw himself into learning and producing as much and as fast as the lathe allowed him to turn.  Appreciative of the tutelage he received from fellow club members of the Woodturners of Olympia, Washington he absorbed everything they offered.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Jay has successfully blended his woodworking and painting skills to create unique polychrome lathe turned and sculpted pieces. These works are inspired by the daily shifting from day to night, the mysteries and imagery of nature, the textures, layers and undulations of the landscape and most particularly images of deep space.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Jay�s work has been featured in �American Woodturner� and �Woodturning Magazine�, published in the UK.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Design for the Woodturner</strong></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Everything is designed � cars, buildings even dogs � �cock-a-poos� to �labradoodles�.   We can over design.  But when we don�t have a design, or even when we do, we can end up with some pretty ugly things.  Learn about the principles of design from a wood turning perspective in this fast moving participatory workshop.</font>
