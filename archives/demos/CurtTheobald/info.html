 <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Curt Theobald, an artist based in Pine Bluffs, Wyoming, has been a full-time studio woodturner since 2002.  His background as a cabinetmaker and his knowledge of wood movement and precise joinery are apparent in his work and his teaching.  Much of Curt�s work is directly related to his life experiences as a stay-at-home dad, interactions with his daughters, life�s challenges, and daily events.  His work resides in public and private collections worldwide including the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Franklin G. Burroughs-Simeon B. Chapin Art Museum of Myrtle Beach, The Peabody Essex Museum, the American Association of Woodturners, and Ivinson Memorial Hospital.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Segmenting: Where do you start?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">There is more to segmented turning than gluing pieces of wood together and then going to the lathe to turn a segmented bowl.  This demonstration, geared to all skill levels, will help you learn where to begin or how to refine your current skills.  We will discuss wood choices, wood movement, planning, design considerations and material preparation to help you better understand how to create successful segmented projects.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Segmented Bowl Construction</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Don�t let the apparent complexity of a segmented pattern intimidate you.  By participating in this presentation and watching the methods conveyed, attendees will learn how to accurately plan their own projects and begin to foresee any potential problems before any wood is cut.  I will show how to create patterns that can be used to enhance segmented woodturnings.  Many methods will be shared to help attendees more easily and accurately perform segmented pattern glue-ups in their own workshop, in addition to learning multiple timesaving techniques.

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Thinking Outside of the Box</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes it can be difficult to make segmented turnings that stand out from other segmented works.  This session, which is beneficial to both segmented and non-segmented turners, will challenge attendees to think differently about the creation of their work.  We will take a step-by-step look at a sculptural piece I created and discuss the steps I pursued to make my vision a reality.  Some of the topics presented will be inspiration, evolution of design, problem solving, prototyping, and creation of the piece.

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Open Segmented Turning</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Open segmented turning is gluing multiple pieces of wood together, leaving gaps between each segment to create interesting effects, designs and illusions that highlight qualities of a variety of woods.  In this demonstration, attendees will learn technique and theory, explore design concepts, and have a have a better understanding of the adventure known as open segmented turning.

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Segmenting Stone</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In this presentation we will discuss the techniques necessary to successfully glue and turn stone.  There is an endless variety of stone that can be used to create interesting segmented turnings.  We will discuss techniques necessary to work with Alabaster, Soapstone, Pyrophyllite, and Calcite. Come to this session to learn where to begin.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Pushing Your Work to the Next Level</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">This power point presentation will show fifteen years of my segmented works. I will critique my segmented works and explain positive and negative aspects of each piece. We will discuss the thought process of how to make your work more creative and push your skills to the next level.  Attendees will be challenged to improve their own turnings through the process of seeing how my work has evolved with each successive piece in a series and as an overall body of turnings.
