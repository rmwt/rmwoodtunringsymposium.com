  <p>
    <img src="images/MikeMahoney/mike_mug.jpg" alt="Mike Mahoney" title="Mike Mahoney"> I have been a professional bowlmaker
    since graduating from San Diego State in 1998. My main production items are salad bowls followed by burial urns, hollow
    forms, treenware, and any job that walks through the door. I have been lucky enough to travel the world teaching my craft.
    I have taught in eight countries and across almost every state in our country. I am passionate about my craft and live
    and breathe for it. I never miss an opportunity to educate the public about what woodturning is and the wonderful people
    involved with the craft as a whole.
  </p>

  <h2>Jason Breach</h2>
  <h3><a href="http://www.jasonbreach.co.uk" target="_blank">Jason Breach Woodturner</a></h3>

  <p>
    <img src="images/JasonBreach/Orig_Breach_Jason.jpg" alt="Jason Breach" title="Jason Breach"> Born and lives in Devon,
    England. Jason was introduced to the woodturning lathe at the age of twelve, through schooling and with the support of
    his parents this interest developed. At the age of 15 he attended a woodturning course with Cecil Jordan held at Parnham
    House in Dorset; this week long course covered a wide range of items, but also introduced him to the simple art of the
    turned wooden box. On finishing school, he attended college studying Furniture Design and Management, obtaining a BA
    (Hons). He then worked for a number of years making bespoke kitchens and furniture allowing him to develop and hone his
    skills. As much as he enjoys making furniture, his real enjoyment and enthusiasm has always been working upon the wood
    lathe, even though like most turners Jason can turn his hand to most projects and disciplines, his flair for making and
    developing ideas for turned wooden boxes is his main interest.
  </p>
  <p>
    His development of ideas for turned wooden boxes pushes his creative skills and has led him to create a number of boxes that
    have won competitions within the UK. The "Orbital Arc box" series is his main design focus at present.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="right" src="images/JasonBreach/Jason.jpg" alt="Jason Breach at the lathe" title="Jason Breach at the lathe">    Pushing these creative skills and develop new ideas is only limited within Jason eyes by the fact that wood as the material
    is unique, the natural colour and grain pattern should always play a part within this, and not be hidden.
  </p>
  <p>
    He has demonstrated throughout the UK, Australia, Europe, and America, he enjoys demonstrating but is also in demand as a
    woodturning tutor passing on these skills. His enthusiasm for turning is a major creative force in his demonstrations
    and teaching.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently Jason spends much of his time tutoring these hand skills and techniques. This has enabled him to develop his teaching
    skills, allowing him to explain and educate the learners within classes or at club demonstrations with clear verbal descriptions
    explaining these skills, over the years he has realizes that there are a lot of hobby turners looking to learn and progress,
    and understands how important it is to be translate his skill with clear verbal description.

    making skills, allowing me to cover the design, wood selection, a range of tool techniques, reverse chucking, sanding
    and finishing the completed box. These aspects come together to create a simple looking box with flowing curves.
  </p>

  <h3>Pagoda Box</h3>
  <p> <img src="images/JasonBreach/2010-06-12_17.46.55.jpg" alt="Set of 4 boxes" title="Set of 4 boxes"> As much as the shape
    of this box is based on a box with flowing curves, and is similar to turn, this is a challenge to create as it pushes
    the skill level to turn this square edge box. An explanation of how to achieve a freestanding pagoda style box with raised
    four footed square base and lid. Starting with timber selection, and preparation of the materials, explaining the methods
    of mounting the timber, covering the safety aspects of turning of square edge materials. A wide range of tool techniques
    will be demonstrated from using gouges through to shear scraping, with the techniques described as required to shape
    and hollow to the finished box.

  <p>
    <img src="images/MichaelRoper/roper-headshot.jpg" alt="Michael Roper" title="Michael Roper">I am a third generation woodworker
    who fell in love with woodturning while studying at the Red Rocks Community College School of Fine Woodworking where
    I now teach. The environment I live in greatly influences my work. From my rough natural edge pieces representing our
    times of drought and fire to the simple curves of my bowls and hollow forms representing the curves of snow covered mountains,
    Colorado is not only the place I live but it is also my muse. Besides the natural beauty of the landscape, Colorado offers
    more than 100 different species of trees that grow along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. While many think of
    the Rockies as only yielding Pine, in fact the diversity of Elm, Maple, Walnut, Box Elder and dozens of other workable
    woods each offers their own challenges and intrinsic beauty. I create all my pieces in my cozy mountain studio that looks
    out at the Continental Divide.

    outlet for my creativity. I enjoy finding a piece of wood, envisioning what it can become, and then transforming it into
    a beautiful art or craft piece. I make both art pieces and functional pieces, but I always strive for beauty. My woodturning
    consists all types of turning disciplines including bowls, hollow forms, platters, vases, boxes and furniture components.
    I use a variety of wood species in my work including local urban forested woods like eucalyptus, and other reclaimed wood.
    I also use wood from certified forestry projects in the Pacific Northwest, Mexico and Australia.
  </p>
  <p> I have been an amateur woodworker for over 40 years and an amateur woodturner for more than 15 years. My skills are primarily
    self-taught with assists from various class work, from woodworking publications, and through participation in various woodworking
