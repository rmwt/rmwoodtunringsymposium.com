<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Like many woodturners, I started turning in high school shop class, then, �waited� for retirement to get serious.  I turn everything from ornaments to urns, green wood to segmented pieces.  Talking with a friend of mine that was a funeral director, he stated there was a desire for locally produced wood urns, but, they needed to have a screw top lid.  A search on the internet resulted in very few options for getting threads in the urn and lid.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">There is something to be said for �hand-chasing threads�, but, many of the things shouldn�t be said in public!  Plastic plumbing pipe threads is another option suggested, which didn�t seem like something I wanted in such a personal item as a handmade urn.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">After talking with many woodturners, it became very evident there was a need for a simple solution to getting threads into a form with a lid.  Many woodturners simply avoided pieces that needed threads.

The solution I came up with is pre-made threaded inserts produced from kiln-dried hard maple.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Working with Larry Fox, we will demonstrate how the inserts are installed and properly aligned.  Using the methods we demonstrate, you will be able to perfectly center the lid in the opening, then, when the lid is tightened, we will show how to ensure the grain alignment is exactly where you want it to be.</font></p>
