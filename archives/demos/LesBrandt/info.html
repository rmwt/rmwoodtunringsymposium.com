<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Les Brandt is a member of AAW and Stateline Woodturners of Northwest Arkansas and has demonstrated for that club as well as Woodturners of Southwest Missouri and Southwest Association of Turners. Les has taken several week long classes at Arrowmont as well as studying under national turners for classes and hands-on. He started turning in 2003 and went full time in 2010, spending at least 40 hours a week at his lathe for the first five years and so has learned the basics and many techniques for turning different forms and all sorts of embellishments. Found green wood is his preference and he enjoys the opportunity to show people the many looks of wood native to his area.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Platter with Sea Turtle Relief Carved and Inlaid with Calcite, Malachite and Mica</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">This demonstration involves turning a 3/8� x 15� platter, tracing the outline of a Sea Turtle onto the wood and then relief carving the design, 3/16� deep, with a Dremel and 1/8� bits and then inlaying Calcite, Malachite and Mica and bonding with super glue before sanding and finishing. Because of the length of the various steps and waning attention spans, I will bring pieces in
various stages of completion to show the whole process. Tools: Bowl, Detail Gouge and Scrapers as well as handled Dremel with various bits.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Vessel Abrasive Carved Spiral Design</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">This demonstration involves turning a hollow vessel, laying out a spiral design and then �carving� using abrasives. A blank is mounted; shaped, with a tenon; reverse mounted and hollowed. The design is then laid out on the vessel with a compass/divider using a platform in the banjo and the vessel is parted off; after which the design is �carved� using 100 and/or 150 grit sandpaper, depending on the wood; and is sanded with 320 girt. The vessel is then finished if wood look is desired or dyed and black lacquer applied for a �fired pottery� look. All aspects will be demonstrated and discussed but because of time and attention span I will bring pieces in various stages of completion to show entire process.</font></p>
