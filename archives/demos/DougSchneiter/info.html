<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I started woodturning 45 years ago as a wee lad in high school, and still have some of those first projects.  Since then, I have hopefully improved my skills and techniques during my 26 year career of teaching in schools from Jr. High to University, stretching from Iowa to New Mexico and Colorado.  I have given demonstrations across the Western U.S., including Utah, Montana, North Dakota, and Colorado at club meetings, weekend workshops, and symposiums. I still love to teach, and welcome new opportunities.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I am a long time member of the AAW and the Rocky Mountain Woodturners, of which I have been President for 3 separate terms.  I was bestowed with the Lifetime Achievement Award from the RMWT, and was honored as a "Long-time Friend of the Utah Woodturning Symposium" in 2014.  I have shown my work in several shows, including Cheyenne's Western Spirit Art Show and Sale, and as a 6-time artist at Loveland's Sculpture In the Park.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">My work reflects my appreciation and respect for the natural beauty of wood through my minimalistic approach that accentuates the natural colors, grain patterns, and characteristics of the timber, without too much embellishment competing with those strengths.</font></p>


<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Keep It Simple Stupid, Hollow Form Turning Made Easy</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">This demonstration will show how turning hollow forms can be made easy by using simple shapes, simple tools, and simple materials.  There is no need to be intimidated of turning hollow forms, if you follow some simple guidelines.  During this demo, I will also give you some tips and ideas that will hopefully make turning hollow forms a much more enjoyable experience.  I will also be discussing aesthetics, safety, selection of materials and tools, and finishing techniques.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Turning Small Hollow Forms Using Bent Tools</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">This demo will focus on small, baseball-size hollow forms.  I will be turning them using readily available turning and hollowing tools.  During this demo I will also be discussing aesthetics and design, proper tool usage, safety, reversing the piece to finish off the bottom, and final sanding and finishing of the turning.  We will also discuss selection of materials, tools, and getting to understand Fibonacci's number, and how it relates to good design and form.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Turning Hollow Forms With Natural Voids</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">This demonstration will focus on turning hollow forms from timber pieces that contain natural defects such as knots, cracks, or bark inclusions.  I will be discussing the selection of the wood, the mounting orientation of the wood to take advantage of these anomalies, the understanding of Fibonacci's number and the Golden Ratio to maximize the aesthetics of the turning.  I will also cover the safety concerns related to using this type of timber, and the proper tool usage needed to successfully complete these unique turnings.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Lost Wood Turning</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The lost wood process involves turning blanks that are made up of 3 laminated layers. After turning, the middle layer is removed and the two outer layers are re-joined to produce a turned object that isn't round. The finished shape of these turnings can be altered by changing the size of the shape of the center lamination. This technique was shown to me this summer at the Utah Symposium, by Art Liestman from Vancouver, B.C. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Greetings fellow woodturners, my name is Doug Schneiter, and I am just a transplanted Iowa farmboy.  I started woodturning in Jr. and High School using walnut and oak harvested from the trees on our farm.  Loving the hands-on learning, i went to earn my B.A. Degree at Univ. of Northern Iowa in Industrial Arts Education.  After 3 years of teaching woodshop classes in Iowa, I moved to C.S.U. to teach woodworking and get my B.S. Degree.  After 1 more year of teaching, I took a 12 year sabbatical from education.</font><br>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">After a plethora of interesting jobs, I returned to Colorado to teach in Loveland in 1993.  Shortly after arriving, I heard about Rocky Mountain Woodturners and met Lee Carter, who soon showed me how much woodturning had evolved in my 12 year absence, and how much I needed to learn to gety caught up.  Other members of RMWT also gave me lots of guidance and encouragement to improve my skills and get excited about woodturning once again.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I have focused on hollow forms for the past 15 years, and prefer to turn "difficult" woods that may include bark inclusions, knots, crotches and burls, etc., that in my opinion make the turning process more challenging, and the results more interesting.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I have had the opportunity to be a demonstrator at many RMWT monthly meetings and Symposiums, and have also presented at the Utah Woodturning Symposium.  This summer will be my 5th appearance at Sculpture in the Park Art Show.  Pictures of my work can be seen on the RMWT website, in the instant gallery photos.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I will be doing 2 general rotations and 1 rotation in the hands-on learning center this year.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Session 1 - Turning Hollow Forms with Natural Voids</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I will demonstrate positioning of the wood on the lathe to get the best out of the timber, and will continue with the hollowing procedure showing the use of different hollowing tools.  I will finish up the demo showing how to sand and finish the piece.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Session 2 - Small Hollow Forms</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I'll show the different tools and techniques that can be used on smaller hollow forms.  I will show how fun it can be to do a hollow form, start to finish, in a small time period.  These small hollow forms make nice gifts and accents.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Hands-on Session - Making Hollow Form Turning Simple and Enjoyable</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">For those who are wanting to get into it, but are a little bit intimidated by the process.  There are some important factors to follow that will take alot of the mystery and difficulty out of turning hollow forms.  Remember; It can't be that hard, or I wouldn't be doing it!</font></p>
