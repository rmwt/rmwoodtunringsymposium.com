<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Michael Blankenship is a completely blind woodturner.  He became blind from a very rare disease in 2003.  He was a woodworker all of his life but NEVER turned wood until he became blind.  Michael taught himself to turn wood by listening to videos.  He belongs to two woodturning clubs to help him learn new techniques and skills.  These clubs give him the opportunity to learn from other turners and try new styles of turning.  His love for turning has given him a new purpose and keeps him very busy.</font></p>
