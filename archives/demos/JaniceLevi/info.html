<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I was first introduced to woodturning as a child by my father who would let me hold a turning tool while his hands guided mine to shape pot handles and knobs�all functional, no art.  As I approached retirement from 35 years in education (as a drama teacher then alternative school counselor), I became fascinated once again with woodturning.  I asked for a lathe for my birthday and immediately joined the local turning club.  It was truly a man�s world but the mentoring program was outstanding.  I was taught toolmanship first then learned how to turn bowls, platters, boxes, ornaments.  After a whole lot of those, I began to decorate them�carving, coloring, sand blasting, burning.  Today, I am concentrating on turning and enhancing purses and jewelry.  They are precious little canvases just begging for new and gaudy ideas.  The added bonus is that these turnings can be worn!</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In the woodturning world, I have served as president of the two clubs to which I belong�Gulf Coast Woodturners and Brazos Valley Woodturners and president of the Southwest Association of Woodturners (SWAT).  I have demonstrated and taught hands-on classes across the SWAT region.  This year I will be demonstrating �Pyrography Basics� at the AAW symposium in Pittsburgh and �Jewelry Made Easy� at the SWAT symposium in Waco, TX.  My article, �Jewelry Made Easy,� appeared in the February, 2015 edition of American Woodturner, the AAW journal.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The attendees will learn to turn elegant jewelry pieces without the need for special chucks or jigs.  I begin by demonstrating how to turn a crossgrain feature pendant using a wasteblock and double-sided tape.  Then I show how to turn pendant disks of all sizes using endgrain stock held in a chuck.  Finally, turning beads of varying sizes will be demonstrated without need for special mandrels.  Of course, all of these items can be enhanced with grooves, spirals, chatterwork, pyrography and color, to name a few.  The demo ends by showing how to assemble the pieces with j<img src="images/levi-Acorn Purse.jpg" width="400" height="266">ewelry findings onto a chain or cord.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Pyrography Basics</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Pyrography is an effective tool for enhancing many turnings.  This demo will explore the kinds of wood burners available, including homemade burners.  Each type will be demonstrated, along with special safety precautions for using the equipment.  Both branding and art pyrography will be covered, along with information for finding, selecting and applying patterns.  Helpful hints about tip selection, heat control, burning techniques and color application will be included.</font></p>
