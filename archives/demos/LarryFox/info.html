<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Larry Fox has been turning for 20 years and specializes in the inlay, outlay and cutaway of turquoise in bowls, vases and urns. He has sold 1000�s of pieces through craft shows, web site, galleries and retail stores. This year he has teamed up with Milo Scott to demo the use of pre-made threaded inserts for screw-on tops for boxes and urns.

This demo will show how to make threaded box or urn lids using pre-made threaded inserts. The pre-made threaded inserts consist of a top and bottom (male and female parts) that when properly attached to a turning will result in a perfectly aligned top and base that screws together. With this method there is no need to learn the art of �thread chasing� that frequently ends in the misalignment of the top and bottom wood grains.

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Each student will make a small but simple box with a lid and bottom. Then you will glue the male insert to the lid and the female insert to the bottom. Finally you will be shown how to align the threaded insert pieces so that when you screw the lid on tightly the top and bottom grains will line up perfectly.</font></p>
