<img src="images/stuart-batty.jpg" width="298" height="198">
<img src="images/batty-cocobolo-point-bowl.jpg" width="204" height="230">
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Stuart is a third-generation woodturner, being a full-time production turner and teacher in his father�s studio at age 16. At 19, he started working for Craft Supplies in England, at the time the world�s largest supplier to woodturners. During his 6 years at Craft Supplies, he was the in-house woodturning teacher and demonstrator. He set up Craft Supplies� first sawmill and oversaw their import business that sold more than 300 exotic woods from around the world.
Stuart has been a professional turner for 36 years and has taught more than 5,000 amateur and professional woodturners.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Stuart�s style of work is greatly influenced by his background as a spindle turner with precise cuts and sharp detail. He uses very simple tools to create his pieces. His work is pure lathe work, with no carving or surface texturing.
</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Stuart�s artwork has been sold through galleries across Europe and the US. He also has artwork displayed in the permanent White House collection.
Stuart believes we have only skimmed the surface of the potential of a wood lathe. With production woodturning as his background, his foundation in woodturning helped him perfect the push cut style and other useful techniques, such as negative rake scraping.</font></p>


<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Bowl Turning with the 40/40 Grind & The Bottom Bowl Gouge Grinds</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The bowl gouge with its 40 degree bevel and 40 degree straight wings is capable of large volume cuts directly to finish without any torn grain. In this demonstration, I�ll be showing how to create both the 40/40 bowl gouge and the bottom bowl gouge grinds freehand on a platform. I will show how both gouges are controlled to form the desired shape with little physical effort and repeatability.
</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Off Center Square/Winged Bowl Turning</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In this demonstration, I�ll be showing how to minimize off balance problem while turning. This demo will include both gouge work and negative rake scraping. I will be demonstrating how to easily finish the wings of the bowl with no torn grain or damage to the edges of the piece and how to mate to the wing surface to the bowl shape, leaving a very clean sharp corner.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Perfecting the Art of Cutting</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In this demonstration, I�ll be covering the 7 Fundamentals Setups to eliminate most of the variables in woodturning. I�ll will be demonstrating and explaining how I cut the wood to avoid any torn grain on any species of wood, using a maximum of two pounds of pressure. I�ll also be explaining that knowing grain direct is essential to good cutting and that the techniques for spindle and bowl turning are vertically identical.

                    <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Cindy Drozda, Boulder Colorado, has worked wood professionally since her first �real� job at age 19, where she taught herself to work with wood. The need to make a pair of chairs brought her to woodturning, but it was the pictures of bowls, vessels, and boxes in the back of Dale Nish�s book that really got her hooked. Before settling on woodturning as a career Cindy worked as a cabinet maker, rebuilt airplanes, machined metal, and made hang gliding equipment.</font></p>


<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Today, her pieces are exhibited at the finest art shows and galleries. Her elegant lidded vessels and boxes with delicate finials bring a contemporary flair to classic forms. A jewel hidden under the lid symbolizes the treasure that life reveals when we make the effort to look deeper. Her trademarks are precise techniques, fine details, and pleasing forms. Cindy will coach you to new levels of excellence in your woodturning!</font></p>

<p><strong>My signature style of Box with a finial, an in-fitting   lid, and an inlayed decorative ring and foot made from contrasting   wood. The Finial Box is an intricate and interesting project, with a lot   of tips and   techniques. This presentation includes: boxmaking, turning a finial,   design, material selection, and jam chucking.</strong></p>

My skills are primarily self-taught with assists from various class work, from woodworking publications, and through participation in various woodworking clubs. I have studied with many noted wood artists including, Allan Batty, Stuart Batty, Christian Burchard, Jimmy Clewes, Don Derry, Michael, Hosaluk, John Jordan, Binh Pho, Richard Raffan, Merryll Saylan, and Susan Working. My dad gets the credit for instilling in me a passion for hand-made wood items.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><h2>Keith Gotschall - <a href="http://keithgotschall.com/woodturning" target="_blank">Woodturning</a></h2></font>
<img src="images/gotschall-headshot-2.jpeg" width="226" height="169">
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Born in Chicago, Ill. in 1962, Keith lived in the midwest until 1980.  In 1981 he moved to Boulder Co. and began a career in wood working.  After an informal apprenticeship in several different wood shops Keith started his own design and fabrication studio in 1989.  Building furniture mostly on a commission basis, Keith also stretched his talents by doing the occasional speculative piece that would be shown in art galleries or in fine art shows.  He has won numerous awards around Colorado.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Keith is also a sculptor of stone.  Using marble and alabaster from the area Keith has also won many awards for his sculpture.  His work tends to be of a figurative nature, often abstracting the human form.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFFFF">In 1998 Keith visited with a local wood turning friend who let him play around with some of his tools and showed him some of the more modern theory behind wood turning.  Remembering that the lathe was the reason he became interested in woodworking in the first place, Keith was keen to pursue wood turning from that moment on.</font></p>
 <p><font color="#FFFFFF">He now lives in the small mountain community  of Salida,in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. His home and studio are at the base of the continental divide and he shares them with his  wife Catherine.  An avid rock climber, hiker, and hunter, Keith is often found outdoors enjoying Colorados rugged beauty.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">A bowl and matching lid will be made in this demo, a lot of ground to cover in an hour and a half. The uses of the scroll chuck will be gone over for both expansion and contracting modes. Tool use and design potential will be addressed. Great for the novice or intermediate turner.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Secret Salt Shaker</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">This project is a fun reversal on the classic salt shaker. It�s design puts the opening on the bottom, yet no salt is spilled. It is a unique but simple mechanism that allows it to work, but can be a puzzle to figure out. Covered in this demo are basic spindle cuts, as well as aspects of box making. Hollowing end grain with various techniques is shown, and the �back cut� will be demonstrated. Other design options will be discussed and explored. A very fun project that you will want to try out at home.</font></p>

                <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Tom began turning wood as a young boy. After graduating from Roanoke College with a degree in Physics, Tom began traveling extensively. He lived in Europe, Asia, and 9 US States. The lathe in his dad�s workshop became distant memory.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">About 20 years ago Tom found himself working for the Hewlett-Packard Company in Chicago, and living in a house with a spacious basement. He bought a lathe, and began turning wood again. At first he made mostly furniture, but almost by chance, he attended a demonstration by Richard Raffan, a very well-known Australian woodturner, who specializes in turning beautiful wooden bowls. Richard took a rough piece of American black cherry timber and turned it into a wonderful bowl. Tom was hooked.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Thus began Tom�s interest in creating art pieces on the lathe. He now turns primarily bowls and platters from a variety of woods. His favorite is figured maple.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">John's pieces are initially turned on the lathe, from fresh, green logs, using a number of techniques and tools that have evolved over the years. Each piece is then hand carved and textured, using a variety of different hand and small powered tools. This texturing process is very labor intensive, and can take as much as several days to weeks to complete. There is little room for error during this carving- one small slip can ruin the piece. A light lacquer finish is applied to most pieces, including the dyed work.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Jay has always been an artist.  From his earliest memories he has played with clay or drew or painted.  Upon entering higher education he had planned to continue his study of pottery but became enchanted with painting.  After finishing his undergraduate degree, he pursued and completed a master of fine arts degree focusing on painting and drawing.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">To support his family and his passion for art, Jay worked in the environmental protection field and contributed to many successful and award winning waste reduction and recycling programs.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">During that time he continued to produce art works and became proficient in woodworking and furniture making.  One day he made a table top.  He thought �this table needs round legs, not squared legs from a table saw.  So he bought a lathe.  He turned the legs, and thought �wow, this is fun!�  Well, he never finished the table and has not made a piece of furniture since.  He has been so taken by woodturning he threw himself into learning and producing as much and as fast as the lathe allowed him to turn.  Appreciative of the tutelage he received from fellow club members of the Woodturners of Olympia, Washington he absorbed everything they offered.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Jay has successfully blended his woodworking and painting skills to create unique polychrome lathe turned and sculpted pieces. These works are inspired by the daily shifting from day to night, the mysteries and imagery of nature, the textures, layers and undulations of the landscape and most particularly images of deep space.</font></p>

							<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Jay�s work has been featured in �American Woodturner� and �Woodturning Magazine�, published in the UK.</font></p>

                            <p>Born in Chicago, Ill. in 1962, Keith lived in the midwest until 1980.  In 1981 he moved to Boulder Co. and began a career in wood working.  After an informal apprenticeship in several different wood shops Keith started his own design and fabrication studio in 1989.  Building furniture mostly on a commission basis, Keith also stretched his talents by doing the occasional speculative piece that would be shown in art galleries or in fine art shows.  He has won numerous awards around Colorado.</p>
    <p>Keith is also a sculptor of stone.  Using marble and alabaster from the area Keith has also won many awards for his sculpture.  His work tends to be of a figurative nature, often abstracting the human form.
    <p>In 1998 Keith visited with a local wood turning friend who let him play around with some of his tools and showed him some of the more modern theory behind wood turning.  Remembering that the lathe was the reason he became interested in woodworking in the first place, Keith was keen to pursue wood turning from that moment on.</p>
 <p>He now lives in the small mountain community  of Salida,in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. His home and studio are at the base of the continental divide and he shares them with his  wife Catherine.  An avid rock climber, hiker, and hunter, Keith is often found outdoors enjoying Colorados rugged beauty.</p>

I had never turned before and so everything was new to me at that time, I took one shop class in high school but no one ever got close to the lathe. I progressed through the years and I can say that I turly enjoy the challenge of truning and teaching other people how to use the lathe.

This demo will show how to make threaded box or urn lids using pre-made threaded inserts. The pre-made threaded inserts consist of a top and bottom (male and female parts) that when properly attached to a turning will result in a perfectly aligned top and base that screws together. With this method there is no need to learn the art of �thread chasing� that frequently ends in the misalignment of the top and bottom wood grains.

I turn everything from ornaments to urns, green wood to segmented pieces.  Talking with a friend of mine that was a funeral director, he stated there was a desire for locally produced wood urns, but, they needed to have a screw top lid.  A search on the internet resulted in very few options for getting threads in the urn and lid.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">There is something to be said for �hand-chasing threads�, but, many of the things shouldn�t be said in public!  Plastic plumbing pipe threads is another option suggested, which didn�t seem like something I wanted in such a personal item as a handmade urn.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">After talking with many woodturners, it became very evident there was a need for a simple solution to getting threads into a form with a lid.  Many woodturners simply avoided pieces that needed threads.

The solution I came up with is pre-made threaded inserts produced from kiln-dried hard maple.</font></p>

<p><img src="images/angelo-headshot.jpg" width="286" height="216"><img src="images/angelo-colored-pot.jpg" width="245" height="203"></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Sam has been drawn to working with wood for 45 years.  His experience includes furniture making and restoration, as well as custom cabinetry.  Turning chair and table components set the foundation for a passion for working on the lathe.  Retiring after 39 years in public education, Sam turns daily in his shop in north central Wyoming.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In 2007, he organized a woodturning group that has met monthly since.  In 2010 the Worland Wyoming Woodturners became an AAW sanctioned chapter.  Sam has written articles for Woodturning Design Magazine, been recognized as the featured artist in Woodturning magazine (issue 256-August 2013), and enjoys teaching and demonstrating.  Known as the wyomingwoodturner on YouTube, Sam has produced 230 videos on many topics of woodturning.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">With the help of British turner John Berkeley, author of All Screwed Up, Sam has developed his thread chasing skills.  His four rotations will cover the mechanics of hand chased threads, incorporating threads into a project, and how design plays into boxes with hand-chased threads.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The most important point in the creation of my work is the moment just before a project begins. Whatever skill, experience, and design capabilities I have, now come into play as I take the first step toward making a piece. Once the direction is set, I move forward with my initial intentions and make changes when necessary.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">A particular painting may not be beautiful to everyone. But that same painting will elicit a reaction: an emotion, an opinion or criticism, or an idea that will be a seed for more art. As artists, we are influenced by the creativity of others. I am careful not to allow this same influence to restrict or set limits on my work.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">My current interests include hand chasing threads and coloring wood. I often combine these two disciplines while making a hollow form with a threaded lid and finial. My focus continues to move away from untouched natural wood and toward adding color, applying a sprayed and buffed, lacquered finish or applying a secondary wood as an accent.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Hand Chased Threads: Fundamentals</strong></font><img src="images/angelo-thread-chasing.jpg" width="216" height="384"></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The scope of this demonstration will range from the basics of chasing threads by hand, to the fine points necessary for success.  I will cover the selection of thread chasers, sharpening, preparation of the male tenon and female recess, and the importance of wood selection.  I will demonstrate the use of the traditional tools of thread chasing: point tool, inside tool, armrest, and female recess tool.  Successful thread chasing depends on wood, sharp tools, and understanding how the male and female threads mate for a good connection.  My experience with thread chasing has been influenced by Allan Batty, Bill Jones, and John Berkeley.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Thread Chasing-Lidded Box</strong></font><img src="images/angelo-small-boxes.JPG" width="346" height="194"></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In this demonstration I will cover the proper sequence for the successful completion of a lidded box with threaded fitment.  This procedure includes chasing the female threads in the lid, the male threads in the base, and turning a female �screw chuck� for finishing the bottom of the box.  In this �project� oriented demo, I will utilize the tools and approach that best represents proper thread chasing by hand.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Thread Chasing</strong></font></p><img src="images/angelo-pill-boxes.jpg" width="370" height="208">

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In this demonstration I will cover design elements of lidded boxes and complete a simple threaded container.  This discussion regarding form will include lidded boxes and explore how form effects the placement of the �join� in a project.  Thread Placement and the procedure for chasing threads is determined largely by form or shape.  I will complete a simple threaded box.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Threaded Inserts</strong></font></p><img src="images/angelo-thread.jpg" width="288" height="210">
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">This demonstration will focus on creating hand chased threaded inserts for a project.  Only very dense, straight-grained woods will take an acceptable thread.  Consequently, it is a challenge to utilize softer woods.  Employing this technique will allow you to virtually use any wood in a threaded project.  I will discuss how specific gravity plays an important role in wood selection for chasing threads.  I will demonstrate the procedure for attaching a threaded insert into the opening of a hollow form as well as turning the corresponding threaded lid for the container.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Woodworking has been a major interest of mine for many years now. My early training came from college level woodworking and furniture design courses in San Diego, while my later training came from courses taken in the Fine Woodworking Department at Red Rocks Community College (RRCC) where I currently teach.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">While I enjoy making projects from furniture to small craft items, turning projects are by far my favorites.  I feel nothing highlights and celebrates the beauty of wood quite the same way as turnings.  In addition to turning wood, I also like to incorporate metal into some of my pieces through the use of metal spinning and other techniques.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Currently I run my own small woodworking business and teach courses in, depending on the semester, general woodworking, furniture making, and turning. For more, visit www.facebook.com/glacialstudio</font></p>


<img src="images/wilson-Metal Accent Box.JPG" width="427" height="285">

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I was first introduced to woodturning as a child by my father who would let me hold a turning tool while his hands guided mine to shape pot handles and knobs�all functional, no art.  As I approached retirement from 35 years in education (as a drama teacher then alternative school counselor), I became fascinated once again with woodturning.  I asked for a lathe for my birthday and immediately joined the local turning club.  It was truly a man�s world but the mentoring program was outstanding.  I was taught toolmanship first then learned how to turn bowls, platters, boxes, ornaments.  After a whole lot of those, I began to decorate them�carving, coloring, sand blasting, burning.  Today, I am concentrating on turning and enhancing purses and jewelry.  They are precious little canvases just begging for new and gaudy ideas.  The added bonus is that these turnings can be worn!</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In the woodturning world, I have served as president of the two clubs to which I belong�Gulf Coast Woodturners and Brazos Valley Woodturners and president of the Southwest Association of Woodturners (SWAT).  I have demonstrated and taught hands-on classes across the SWAT region.  This year I will be demonstrating �Pyrography Basics� at the AAW symposium in Pittsburgh and �Jewelry Made Easy� at the SWAT symposium in Waco, TX.  My article, �Jewelry Made Easy,� appeared in the February, 2015 edition of American Woodturner, the AAW journal.</font></p>
<img src="images/levi-necklace-01.jpg" width="288" height="432">
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Jewelry Made Easy</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The attendees will learn to turn elegant jewelry pieces without the need for special chucks or jigs.  I begin by demonstrating how to turn a crossgrain feature pendant using a wasteblock and double-sided tape.  Then I show how to turn pendant disks of all sizes using endgrain stock held in a chuck.  Finally, turning beads of varying sizes will be demonstrated without need for special mandrels.  Of course, all of these items can be enhanced with grooves, spirals, chatterwork, pyrography and color, to name a few.  The demo ends by showing how to assemble the pieces with j<img src="images/levi-Acorn Purse.jpg" width="400" height="266">ewelry findings onto a chain or cord.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Pyrography Basics</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Pyrography is an effective tool for enhancing many turnings.  This demo will explore the kinds of wood burners available, including homemade burners.  Each type will be demonstrated, along with special safety precautions for using the equipment.  Both branding and art pyrography will be covered, along with information for finding, selecting and applying patterns.  Helpful hints about tip selection, heat control, burning techniques and color application will be included.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I started woodturning 45 years ago as a wee lad in high school, and still have some of those first projects.  Since then, I have hopefully improved my skills and techniques during my 26 year career of teaching in schools from Jr. High to University, stretching from Iowa to New Mexico and Colorado.  I have given demonstrations across the Western U.S., including Utah, Montana, North Dakota, and Colorado at club meetings, weekend workshops, and symposiums. I still love to teach, and welcome new opportunities.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I am a long time member of the AAW and the Rocky Mountain Woodturners, of which I have been President for 3 separate terms.  I was bestowed with the Lifetime Achievement Award from the RMWT, and was honored as a "Long-time Friend of the Utah Woodturning Symposium" in 2014.  I have shown my work in several shows, including Cheyenne's Western Spirit Art Show and Sale, and as a 6-time artist at Loveland's Sculpture In the Park.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">My work reflects my appreciation and respect for the natural beauty of wood through my minimalistic approach that accentuates the natural colors, grain patterns, and characteristics of the timber, without too much embellishment competing with those strengths.</font></p>


<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Keep It Simple Stupid, Hollow Form Turning Made Easy</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">This demonstration will show how turning hollow forms can be made easy by using simple shapes, simple tools, and simple materials.  There is no need to be intimidated of turning hollow forms, if you follow some simple guidelines.  During this demo, I will also give you some tips and ideas that will hopefully make turning hollow forms a much more enjoyable experience.  I will also be discussing aesthetics, safety, selection of materials and tools, and finishing techniques.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Turning Small Hollow Forms Using Bent Tools</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">This demo will focus on small, baseball-size hollow forms.  I will be turning them using readily available turning and hollowing tools.  During this demo I will also be discussing aesthetics and design, proper tool usage, safety, reversing the piece to finish off the bottom, and final sanding and finishing of the turning.  We will also discuss selection of materials, tools, and getting to understand Fibonacci's number, and how it relates to good design and form.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Turning Hollow Forms With Natural Voids</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">This demonstration will focus on turning hollow forms from timber pieces that contain natural defects such as knots, cracks, or bark inclusions.  I will be discussing the selection of the wood, the mounting orientation of the wood to take advantage of these anomalies, the understanding of Fibonacci's number and the Golden Ratio to maximize the aesthetics of the turning.  I will also cover the safety concerns related to using this type of timber, and the proper tool usage needed to successfully complete these unique turnings.</font></p>

<img src="images/schneider-lostwood.JPG" width="364" height="272">
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Lost Wood Turning</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The lost wood process involves turning blanks that are made up of 3 laminated layers. After turning, the middle layer is removed and the two outer layers are re-joined to produce a turned object that isn't round. The finished shape of these turnings can be altered by changing the size of the shape of the center lamination. This technique was shown to me this summer at the Utah Symposium, by Art Liestman from Vancouver, B.C. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Born in Omaha, Nebraska in 1942, Steve�s early interest in woodworking led to a degree in Industrial Education from Iowa State University, followed by a 33-year career in industry and social services facilities management. Woodworking was a hobby, concentrating on furniture and clocks. In 1975, he read Dale Nish�s <u>Creative Woodturning</u>, which sparked what has become a passionate interest in artistic woodturning. By 1998 he was turning fulltime and in 2001 he and his wife Anne added a studio to their Bettendorf, Iowa home.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Steve concentrates on developing intricate surface decoration using silver leaf, acrylics and ink on hollow vessels turned primarily of maple, walnut or cherry. His works are found in museums, galleries and collections from New York to California and have been featured in art and craft publications in the United States, England and Australia. The Cheongju International Craft Biennele in South Korea has exhibited his work three times and in 2003 awarded him a special citation.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">His work is in three midwestern museums, the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts, and the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City. He is included in the 2009 book Masters: Woodturning: Major Works by Leading Artists. Another book, Wood Art Today 2, published in 2010, features his newer ultra thin �Spool� series. The latest book to include Steve is Audacious: The Fine Art of Wood, published in 2015.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I have a passion for woodworking that started as far back as I can remember but I have been turning for only 14 years.  Sure, I knew what a lathe was � I didn�t know what amazing things you could do with one.  After my first Dakota Woodturners meeting, I started looking at wood totally differently.  Now I look at the color, grain, spalting, occlusions, edges and what I can transform each piece into.  I love to teach others the things that I�ve learned and share my techniques as well as tales of disaster.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">My turning techniques and inspiration come from the many symposiums, demonstrations and woodturning classes I have attended over the years.  My turning techniques reflect a melding of the turning styles of Trent Bosch, Alan Lacer, Dick Sing, Allen Jensen, Michael Gibson, Pete Holtus and the list goes on.  I also take inspiration from the members of my local woodturning AAW Chapter.  I enjoy each opportunity to interact with new woodturners, their excitement and enthusiasm gives me more energy to expand my woodturning capabilities.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Everything and Anything You Ever Wanted to Know About the Skew</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The skew is the most valued tool in the woodturners toolbag except for the bowl gouge.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I will go through every cut imaginable using the skew ranging from roughing out, to simple planning, to peeling, to long point leading, short point leading, facing cuts across end grain, making beads (short and long point) leading and coves, making v-cuts,
understanding the tied underhand grip, making rings from the spindle, using the skew as a
negative rake scraper on bowls and platters, using the skew  for boring, centering for pre-drilling and finishing the bottoms of boxes to create square bottoms that are smoothe.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In addition, I will complete some simple projects in which only the skew is used from
beginning to end and finally do a duplicate spindle turning with a multiplicity
of elements using only the skew and completed to specified caliper dimensions.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Lastly, woodturninging practices of how to sharpen the skew will be discussed and
demonstrated to obtain a razor sharp tool.

steps of blank preparation, hollowing sequence steps, and post hollowing procedures.
The hollowing will be done utilizing a camera set-up to obtain a thin walled vessel capable of being pierced.  This technique of camera utilization will be directly compared with fibre optic and laser techniques as alternate methods for obtaining thin walled hollow vessels.  The advantages and disadvantages of each method will be discussed and demonstrated  A final procedure using tension pins as a depth stop to obtain thin wall vessels for piercing will also be discussed and demonstrated.</font></p>

He will walk you through the selection of the wood, the decision for which end becomes the top and the bottom, set up, and mounting on the lathe.  The making of the tenon for holding in a chuck, dividing the piece in two for the base and the lid, and jam chucking for holding and finish turning each piece will also be covered.  Some fine details will be added, sanding, and initial finishing will be also on the agenda.  The session will also include some finished examples of his many small boxes.

This simple process will start with obtaining the raw antler (how, where, how much $$$), the preparation of the antler (stabilization), centering, and the addition of a tenon for a chuck. The antler will be turned, sanded, and polished � and the tops and bottoms turned, using jam chucks, with contrasting hard wood.  Examples of several finished boxes will be provided, as well as ideas for more complicated projects out of elk antler (other boxes, napkin rings). This session provides some insight to the use of other turning materials besides wood.</font><br>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Rick was inspired to start making various sized shop hammers after picking up one of his old ones in his shop and realizing how beat up and ugly it really was. In this session, meant for beginning to intermediate turners, Rick will demonstrate all of the steps necessary to produce a decorative, yet very functional shop hammer.  Turning is started between centers for the basic pieces. Some chuck work is used for producing mortises, while turning between centers is used for making tenons.  Glue up of various pieces will be done followed by final turning and finishing.  Some light sanding is used, and the finish is a simple application of oil. The finished product can be used daily in the shop, until it ultimately becomes beat up and ugly � and the process starts all over.</font><br>

					<p><font color="#FFFFFF">John�s professional career was as an engineer working for a major electronics company during which he worked with a wide variety of equipment and systems. He has been doing woodworking all of his life but when he took early retirement he rediscovered woodturning which has turned into a second career. John applies his unique engineering perspective to woodturning projects to provide understanding of the principles behind the operations. He has been known to �push the envelope� of woodturning technology. Teaching, demonstrations and writing about woodturning topics provides enjoyment and consumes a lot of his time.. He has several articles in the American Woodturner. One of John�s strengths is to provide explanations of why and how things work in a way that is understandable to �normal people�. Two of his American Woodturner articles delve into the mysteries of how vacuum systems work and how to get the most out of them. Another article covers the topic of bowl saver systems and how they work. There are several more articles being developed. John is active in the Rocky Mountain Woodturners in Northern Colorado serving as an officer and is involved with the planning and running the annual RMWT Symposium.</font><br>
					<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Several years ago when I was considering building a vacuum chucking system, I was concerned about the size of the investment only to be used for finishing off the bottoms of bowls. When I finished building the vacuum system, I turned it on and it worked, but how well is it working? The literature I was able to find did not have any information on verifying correct operation nor how to trouble shoot and repair. This led me to study vacuum systems and apply my engineering background to them. I kept pushing to find out what else I could do with it. This led to two articles published in the American Woodturner; Understanding and improving Vacuum Chucking Systems February 2011, Vol 26, No. 1 and Compliant Vacuum Chucking System June 2012, Vol 27, No.3.
Two of the biggest challenges for woodturners are tool control and mounting your project on the lathe.</font></p>

In this rotation, we will go through the various parts of a vacuum chucking system, how to assemble a system, trouble shooting and performance testing. Much of the testing is simple using items you readily have in your shop or garage. Using these techniques, you may be able to improve your system to get more out of its usage.

Growing up on a cattle ranch in Florida with his father and uncles who spent most of their time in the woods, he grew to love the outdoors... trees, water and all things relating to nature. To this day, Rudy�s greatest pleasures come from mountain-biking, canoeing, kayaking, hiking and just being in the woods.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Rudy began working with his hands at a very young age and began to develop his creative eye through photography�his first artistic pursuit. With an education in drafting and design, he drew inspiration from the surroundings of his youth, Rudy began his relationship with wood as a craftsman of fine furniture and cabinetry. His desire to explore wood-turning began to develop when he received a natural-edge turned bowl as a Christmas gift from his best friend two years ago. Since that time, Rudy�s natural sense of curiosity has led him to explore the techniques necessary to transform wood from a simple rough chunk into an piece of aesthetic beauty. He has the ability to look at an object, understand how it is made, and recreate it with very little effort. It is as if his brain is linked to his hands by some arcane memory.</font></P>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">When asked what kind of wood he most likes to turn, Rudy�s response was, �imperfect wood, wood with knots, voids, worm holes, decay or any other flaw or defect. To me this is the beauty that God and nature has provided me with as a starting point, and then it becomes a challenge for me to continue this and create something of beauty for others to enjoy�. Rudy�s turned pieces have been featured in the �Rounding The Four Corners� exhibit 2008 and �Restful Places-Cremation Urns and Objects� 2009 at the AAW Gallery of Wood Art in St. Paul, Minnesota.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Greetings fellow woodturners, my name is Doug Schneiter, and I am just a transplanted Iowa farmboy.  I started woodturning in Jr. and High School using walnut and oak harvested from the trees on our farm.  Loving the hands-on learning, i went to earn my B.A. Degree at Univ. of Northern Iowa in Industrial Arts Education.  After 3 years of teaching woodshop classes in Iowa, I moved to C.S.U. to teach woodworking and get my B.S. Degree.  After 1 more year of teaching, I took a 12 year sabbatical from education.</font><br>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">After a plethora of interesting jobs, I returned to Colorado to teach in Loveland in 1993.  Shortly after arriving, I heard about Rocky Mountain Woodturners and met Lee Carter, who soon showed me how much woodturning had evolved in my 12 year absence, and how much I needed to learn to gety caught up.  Other members of RMWT also gave me lots of guidance and encouragement to improve my skills and get excited about woodturning once again.</font></p>
     <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I have focused on hollow forms for the past 15 years, and prefer to turn "difficult" woods that may include bark inclusions, knots, crotches and burls, etc., that in my opinion make the turning process more challenging, and the results more interesting.</font></p>
     <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I have had the opportunity to be a demonstrator at many RMWT monthly meetings and Symposiums, and have also presented at the Utah Woodturning Symposium.  This summer will be my 5th appearance at Sculpture in the Park Art Show.  Pictures of my work can be seen on the RMWT website, in the instant gallery photos.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I will be doing 2 general rotations and 1 rotation in the hands-on learning center this year.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Session 1 - Turning Hollow Forms with Natural Voids</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I will demonstrate positioning of the wood on the lathe to get the best out of the timber, and will continue with the hollowing procedure showing the use of different hollowing tools.  I will finish up the demo showing how to sand and finish the piece.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Session 2 - Small Hollow Forms</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I'll show the different tools and techniques that can be used on smaller hollow forms.  I will show how fun it can be to do a hollow form, start to finish, in a small time period.  These small hollow forms make nice gifts and accents.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Hands-on Session - Making Hollow Form Turning Simple and Enjoyable</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">For those who are wanting to get into it, but are a little bit intimidated by the process.  There are some important factors to follow that will take alot of the mystery and difficulty out of turning hollow forms.  Remember; It can't be that hard, or I wouldn't be doing it!</font></p>

                            <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Turning Bowls</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I will show you the process I use to convert locally harvested urban timbers into beautiful salad bowls.  Using the wood the right way will ensure the bowl will dry correctly and withstand daily use.  I will cover the process from selecting and harvesting the wood,  rough turning the blank,  Drying,  remounting and returning the dry bowl, Sanding,  reverse chucking methods, and food safe finishing techniques.  Along the way I will cover efficient use of the bowl gouge to remove material quickly, and then cover techniques for clean cutting to reduce sanding.  This is a fast paced but in depth demo for anyone interested in turning bowls.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Hollow Vessels</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The hollow form is what really got me hooked on woodturning.   The unlimited directions that you can take this simple form keeps bringing me back to the lathe.   The options for the vessel start of course with the wood, is it plain or really fancy burl.  But  then you can add color, texture, you can reshape the form with carving.  First we need a hollow form, I will turn a vessel concentrating first on the outside form, after all that is what will endure, the shape.   Proper use of the bowl gouge is critical to good form and a clean surface.  Next I will hollow the vessel and show you the many tools that I use to accomplish my turnings and discuss the various tools available.   I will touch on sanding, then mount the vessel to remove the chucking point, and finally talk about finishing.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Platters</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">All woodturners should have wood plates to serve food on.  I will show the process to make a large serving platter or a smaller dinner plate.  T he most important part is to select  the correct blank to turn the plate from.  I will then cover mounting, rough turning and drying green wood blanks.  We will then finish turn a platter and talk about getting clean cuts to reduce sanding and show some decorative techniques that can be added to more decorative platters.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I was born and raised in Wisconsin, and have lived in Minnesota since 1973. I have always loved working with wood, and my interests have focused on woodturning in recent times. I make a variety of items including utilitarian and gift items, as well as items more properly described as wood art.

  As with all things wood, each item is a unique piece, embodying the highlights and flaws of a specific piece of wood; nature�s palette. I very much enjoy utilizing wood with interesting and unusual features, such a spalting, knots, worm holes and the like.

  I work primarily with woods native to the upper Midwest, including black walnut, black cherry, white birch, white oak, ash, buckthorn and others. I also use some tropical hardwood species, mainly for embellishment, and strive to ensure that this wood is obtained from sustainable sources.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Hands-on Session</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Participants will make and use a simple wooden jig for offset and/or angled turning of bottle stoppers or other small items on a 3/8�-16tpi threaded mount. The jig is held in a 4-jaw chuck and allows linear offset movement and a small degree of angular offset. The goal is to go home with a simple and cheap way to explore offset turning on small pieces prior to purchasing a more sophisticated commercial apparatus. Parts for the jig and stopper blanks to turn will be provided.</font></p>

When hollowing through the face grain, the natural contours of the bark edge form dramatic rims. We will review the entire process: design, blank selection, mounting, shaping the form, surface refinement, hollowing, reverse chucking, turning the bottom, and finishing options                              </font></p>

As a self-taught artist, I have no fear of traditional rules or boundaries that shackle many in the art world. Instead, I draw on deep emotion and an independent personality to nourish my creative process. My goal with turning is to coax out the raw beauty of a piece of wood.

                            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">This demo will discuss the configuration and construction of a typical vacuum System and then progress into methods of evaluating and improving its performance. I will demonstrate how to tune up a vacuum system, Topics covered will include:<br>
                              - Basic configuration, the minimum number of components and how they are used.<br>
                              - Enhanced configurations, simple components that can be added to expand the utility of the system.<br>
                              - Detection and isolation of leaks within the system using commonly available items found in most garages/shops.<br>
                              - How do you fix the leakage?<br>
                              - Discuss the basics of how the vacuum system works, how the vacuum levels are adjusted, etc.<br>
                              - Discuss the question &ldquo;How big of a vacuum pump do I need?&rdquo;<br>
                              - Different types of vacuum pumps their characteristics and their maintenance.<br>
                              - Time permitting, discussion and example of converting am air compressor into a vacuum pump.<br>
                              This demo is based on my article &ldquo;Understanding &ndash; and Improving &ndash; Vacuum Chucking Systems&rdquo; that was published in the February, 2011, issue of the American Woodturner.<br>

                              </strong></font></a></p>
                            <p><a href="http://www.foxywoodz.com" target="_blank"><font color="#FFFFFF">This demo is a natural follow-on to the above demo. I will demonstrate how a vacuum system can be used to mount and turn any shaped block of wood regardless of its shape, surface irregularities or holes and piercing. I do not use any screws or glue nor do I damage or change any surface other than those which are shaped with the turning tools. This is a new method of utilizing the vacuum system that to the best of my knowledge, has never been done before. I will demonstrate how this system can be used to hold a sphere without the need to build a special purpose chuck that will only hold one size.
                              An article on this technique has been written and submitted to the American Woodturner. It has been accepted for publication but the date has not been set. I was told that it should be published this year, 2011.</font></a></p>
                            <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> Inside Out Turning to Construct a Jewelry Organizer</strong></font></p>
                            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Using methods outlined in the article �Turning Diamonds�, American Woodturner , February 2010, I will demonstrate the construction of a jewelry organizer. The central column uses inside-out techniques with the remainder of the parts using a combination of spindle and faceplate turning. Starting with a sketch of the desired finished design, I will show how to make a template to ease the turning process. This design for the central column will then be turned by first turning the inside, turning the parts inside out and then turning the outside. One part has a series of slots spaced around the perimeter. The construction and usage of a fixture to make those slots uniform in length and spacing will be shown and discussed. A finial for the top of the organizer will be turned.</font></p>
