2018 Rocky Mountain Woodturning Symposium
 
Have you registered yet?  We would enjoy seeing you in September! The symposium is a great opportunity to meet fellow Woodturners in a relaxing environment while you learn the latest techniques from some of the best Woodturners in the field.

The Rocky Mountain Woodturning Symposium will be held on September 14, 15 and 16, 2018. It will once again be at The Ranch/Larimer County Fairgrounds, Loveland, Colorado.

Check in starts on Friday, September 14th, from 1 until 5:30 PM. The first rotation is Friday at 3:30pm. Meet and greet the demonstrators on Friday, 6-8 PM, at the Loveland Woodcraft store. There will be more than 42 excellent demonstrations during the weekend from demonstrators, vendors and hands on turning.

Our featured demonstrators this year include Mike Mahoney, Dale Larson, Jason Breach, Sally Ault, Merryll Saylan, Brian Gisi, Joe Fleming, Trent Bosch, Micheal Roper, and Doug Schneiter. We will also have a large trade show, woodturners gallery, banquet, and a live auction Saturday evening conducted by a professional auctioneer.
