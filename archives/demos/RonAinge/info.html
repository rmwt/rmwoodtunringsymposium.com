<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In 2002 I went to an auction where I bought one old lathe that I thought I would sell on Ebay to make a little money. Fortunatly I met a man named Pete Holtus and began takeing lessons on turning things on the lathe.  I soon found out that it was such a high to put a piece of wood on the lathe and in an hour or so I could finish a project.  I had never turned before and so everything was new to me at that time, I took one shop class in high school but no one ever got close to the lathe. I progressed through the years and I can say that I turly enjoy the challenge of truning and teaching other people how to use the lathe. After runing for and being elected to several positions in our club I was elected to the office of president of the Front Range Woodturners in 2009 and again in 2015.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Hands On: Offset Bird House</strong></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">This demo is of an offset bird house that is pictured in the photo.  It starts as an off center piece. I will show the students how to turn the object, drill it and end up with a small bird house that can either sit on a table or be hung as an ornament, this is a quick and fairly easy project that can be done in a class period.</font></p>
