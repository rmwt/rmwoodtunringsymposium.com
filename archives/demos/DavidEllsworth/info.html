                            <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Open Bowl with Natural Edge</strong></font></p>
                            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Making an open bowl from a half log with a natural edge rim using only my Signature gouge. Topics will include locating the bowl in the log, mounting and orienting the grain between centers, roughing out the exterior, shaping with slicing and shear-scraping cuts, interior roughing and finishing cuts, measuring interior depth, using jam chucks to finish the base.</font></p>

                            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">My classic demonstration of making a hollow form from a green log using shop-made hollowing tools and my Signature gouge. Topics include mounting and orienting grain between centers, shaping with Signature gouge using slicing and shear-scraping cuts, mounting using a chuck, final shaping of exterior plus the entire process of hollowing the form.
